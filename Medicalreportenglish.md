**Health Check-up Conclusion & Suggestion**

**Reviewing Physician:** [Signature]

1. **Elevated Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE):**
   This tumor marker is an indicator for small cell lung cancer. This mild abnormality suggests a follow-up outpatient visit to the Respiratory department within 1-3 months. A comprehensive diagnosis will be made based on the follow-up results and clinical history.
2. **Increased Myoglobin Level:**
   It is mainly found in cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle. Levels can be high after a myocardial infarction or exercise-related injury. Strenuous exercise, hepatitis, and hemolytic anemia can also cause an increase. For mild elevations, please consult with Cardiology and Orthopedics departments for follow-up and review, correlating with clinical signs. For significant elevations or if accompanied by chest tightness/pain, please seek immediate medical attention from Cardiology.
3. **Abnormal Liver Function, Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) Abnormality:**
   Medications, alcohol consumption, fatty liver, fatigue, malnutrition, and hepatitis can all cause impaired liver function. (1) Please follow up with the Gastroenterology department to determine the cause and receive targeted treatment. (2) Pay attention to rest, abstain from alcohol, and avoid taking unprescribed medications to reduce the burden on the liver. A diet high in protein and vitamins and low in fat is recommended.
4. **Abnormal Kidney Function, Creatinine Abnormality:**
   This can be related to strenuous exercise, diet, medications, high blood pressure, and kidney disease. (1) It is recommended to correlate with clinical history and follow up with the Nephrology department for comprehensive diagnosis and treatment. (2) A diet low in salt, sodium, and phosphorus, and high in calcium is advised. Pay attention to vitamin supplementation.
5. **High Uric Acid (Hyperuricemia):**
   (1) Seek treatment from an Endocrinology or Nephrology outpatient clinic. (2) Drink plenty of water to promote excretion. (3) Reduce intake of high-purine foods such as animal organs, seafood, and beer.
6. **High Whole Blood Viscosity (at high, medium, and low shear rates):**
   Inadequate water intake, excessive water loss through sweating/diarrhea, as well as high blood lipids and fibrinogen can all lead to increased blood viscosity. High blood viscosity can cause insufficient blood supply to organs and microcirculation disorders, leading to thrombosis. (1) Pay attention to timely rehydration, control blood lipids, and persist in aerobic exercise to improve blood circulation. (2) If necessary, seek a comprehensive diagnosis from the Cardiovascular or Endocrinology departments.
7. **Elevated Total Cholesterol, Elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein, Elevated Non-High-Density Lipoprotein, Elevated Apolipoprotein B, Elevated Lipoprotein(a); Low High-Density Lipoprotein, Elevated Apolipoprotein B, Elevated Lipoprotein(a):**
   Long-term abnormal blood lipids will accelerate arteriosclerosis, form thrombus plaques, and induce coronary heart disease. (1) Adjust lifestyle: quit smoking, limit alcohol, maintain a reasonable diet, and control total calorie intake. (2) Persist in physical exercise to change poor lifestyle habits. (3) If diet and lifestyle adjustments do not achieve ideal control, or if medication control is poor, please consult a hospital to adjust the treatment plan.
8. **Positive Urobilinogen:**
   This is a jaundice-related indicator. It can be elevated due to liver cell damage, hemolytic disease, heart failure, sepsis, etc. For mild abnormalities, it is recommended to follow up with the Gastroenterology department, considering any history of liver/biliary disease or jaundice. For severe abnormalities, a surgical consultation is recommended to determine the cause and provide treatment, in conjunction with clinical and other examinations.

**Health Check-up Conclusion & Suggestion**

**Reviewing Physician:** [Signature]

9. **Positive Urine White Blood Cell Count:**
   Suggests a urinary system infection. (1) For asymptomatic or mild cases, drinking more water to promote urination can lead to self-healing; follow up with an outpatient visit afterward. (2) If accompanied by discomfort during urination, such as frequency, urgency, or pain, please promptly consult with Urology or Nephrology for comprehensive treatment. (3) Keep warm, drink plenty of water, do not hold your urine, and pay attention to local hygiene.
10. **Bilateral Kidney Crystals:**
    A follow-up visit to the Urology department is recommended. Crystals smaller than 4mm in diameter have a 94% chance of being passed spontaneously, but if symptoms like renal colic, urinary tract infection, or obstruction occur, you should seek immediate medical attention at a hospital's Urology department. Drink plenty of water, 2000-2500ml daily, and limit the intake of salt, animal protein, and oxalate-rich foods. Increase physical activity to aid in passing the stones.
11. **Enlarged Prostate with Calcification:**
    A follow-up visit to the Urology department is recommended, considering any clinical symptoms like urinary frequency, urgency, difficulty urinating, or a sensation of incomplete emptying. Pay attention to staying warm, drink adequate water, and avoid alcohol and spicy foods. Do not hold urine, avoid overexertion and prolonged sitting.
12. **Pulmonary Micronodules:**
    A follow-up visit to the Respiratory department is recommended, with regular check-ups to observe for changes.
13. **Elevated Left Eye Pressure (21.5 mmHg); Eye C/D > 0.4:**
    Persistently high intraocular pressure can cause glaucoma, leading to retinal atrophy and blindness. Please consult with the Ophthalmology department for further diagnosis and treatment in conjunction with clinical signs.
14. **External Hemorrhoids:**
    Pay attention to regulating your diet, drink plenty of water, and eat more vegetables, fruits, and other fiber-rich foods to keep bowel movements regular. Avoid spicy foods and alcohol. A warm sitz bath after bowel movements (using regular bath water temperature) can be helpful. Cultivate good work-rest and bowel habits; avoid prolonged sitting or standing. If symptoms like prolapse, bleeding, or pain are significant, it is recommended to visit a proctology clinic for further examination and treatment. Please undergo a digital rectal exam for follow-up during your routine annual check-up.
15. **High Blood Pressure (140/82 mmHg):**
    On the premise of being well-rested, please measure your blood pressure on three consecutive days at three different times. Take the average of the three readings each day. If the average blood pressure value is still above the normal range, you need to take medication under a doctor's guidance. Maintain a balanced state of mind, ensure adequate sleep, and follow a low-salt, low-fat diet. Engage in moderate physical exercise. Maintain a normal weight. High blood pressure is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and can lead to functional changes and damage to the heart, brain, kidneys, blood vessels, and eye fundus. Very high levels can lead to stroke, myocardial infarction, etc.
16. **Chronic Pharyngitis:**
    A consultation with the ENT department is recommended to determine the cause and nature of the condition for targeted treatment. Pay attention to rest, ensure adequate sleep, maintain a regular lifestyle, quit smoking and limit alcohol, eat less irritating food, drink more water, have a light diet, and eat more fruit.
