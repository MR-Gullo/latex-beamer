  # Suppress "Command terminated with space." It's good practice to fix
  # the most obvious ones (like \item), but this warning can be very noisy.

  # Suppress "Interword spacing (`\\ ') should perhaps be used."
  # This is highly contextual and very difficult to fix automatically.

  # Suppress "Intersentence spacing (`\\@') should perhaps be used."

  # Suppress "You should put a space in front of parenthesis."
  # This is often a stylistic preference and safe to ignore.
