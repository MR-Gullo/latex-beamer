## Proposed Lesson Structure (adapted for lecture-based physics)

### 1. HOOK (3-5 min) — replaces boring intro

Start with a **discrepant event** or **prediction question** before teaching anything. This activates prior knowledge and creates cognitive dissonance.

**Format:** Show a demo, video clip, or scenario → ask students to predict/vote → don't reveal answer yet

**Speaker note template:**

> "Show [video/image]. Ask: What will happen when \_\_\_? Use name wheel to call 2-3 students to explain their prediction. Accept all answers without correction. Say: 'Let's find out if you're right by the end of class.'"

**Grade hook:** "Your prediction is worth participation points" (since they won't do ungraded work).

---

### 2. VOCAB DRILL (3-5 min)

Before content, explicitly teach 3-5 key terms with pronunciation practice.

**Structure:**

- Display term + visual + simple definition
- **You say it → Class repeats 3x** (choral response)
- Name wheel → individual student uses word in a sentence
- Brief check: "Which picture shows \_\_\_?"

**Speaker note template:**

> "Term 1: [word]. Pronunciation: [phonetic]. Meaning: [student-friendly definition]. Class repeats 3x. Name wheel: 'Use [word] in a sentence about [context].'"

This is research-backed for ESL: ask students to repeat the word three times after you introduce it, then have them use it in context immediately.

---

### 3. MINI-LECTURE + CONCEPTEST CYCLE (15-20 min)

Replace long lectures with short chunks (5-7 min max) each followed by a ConcepTest.

**Structure per chunk:**

1. **Explain** one concept (5-7 min)
2. **ConcepTest** — multiple choice conceptual question
   - Students vote individually (show of hands/cards)
   - Pair discussion (1-2 min) → vote again
   - Brief explanation (use name wheel to call on someone from majority answer)

Research shows 35-70% correct on first vote is ideal — if too easy or too hard, discussion isn't productive. Peer discussions tend to lead to the correct answer most of the time; students with correct answers are more likely to convince those with incorrect answers.

**Speaker note template:**

> "Present slide. Ask ConcepTest. Individual vote. Say: 'Turn to your neighbor and convince them you're right.' 90 seconds. Re-vote. Name wheel for explanation."

**Grade hook:** Mark students for ConcepTest participation (not correctness — Mazur's research shows grading on participation, not correctness, produces better discussions).

---

### 4. I-DO → WE-DO → YOU-DO (existing practice section)

Keep your current structure — it's solid. Add one tweak:

**Vocab reinforcement:** During You-Do, require students to label their solution with vocabulary terms (e.g., "circle the 'net force' in your diagram").

---

### 5. RETURN TO HOOK (2-3 min)

Come back to the opening prediction. Now students explain using the lesson's vocabulary.

**Speaker note template:**

> "Return to opening question. Name wheel: 'Explain what happens using at least 2 of today's vocabulary words.' Accept 2-3 explanations."

---

### 6. EXIT TICKET (graded, 3 min)

One question tied to the learning objective. Can be a repeat of a ConcepTest or a simple application.

**Speaker note template:**

> "Display exit ticket. Students write answer on slip of paper. Collect. This is graded for completion + correctness."

## Beamer Template Structure

```
\section{Hook}
% Speaker notes: prediction question, name wheel, no reveal

\section{Vocabulary}
% 3-5 terms with visuals, choral repeat, sentence practice

\section{Content Block 1}
\subsection{Explanation}
\subsection{ConcepTest 1}
% Speaker notes: vote → discuss → re-vote → explain

\section{Content Block 2}
\subsection{Explanation}
\subsection{ConcepTest 2}

\section{Problem Practice}
\subsection{I-Do}
\subsection{We-Do}
\subsection{You-Do}

\section{Hook Resolution}
% Return to opening, students explain with vocab

\section{Exit Ticket}
```

## Resources for ConcepTests

University of Maryland has a free Peer Instruction question database for introductory physics, and University of Colorado Boulder has course materials including clicker questions for physics at all levels — downloadable free for verified educators on PhysPort.

- PhysPort: physport.org
- CU Boulder materials are particularly good for high school level

| Constraint               | Solution                                                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grade-motivated students | Participation marks for ConcepTests, graded exit tickets |
| ESL speaking practice    | Choral vocabulary drill + name wheel for explanations    |
| Non-specialist teachers  | Detailed speaker notes with exact scripts                |
| Repeatable structure     | Same 6-section template for every lesson                 |
