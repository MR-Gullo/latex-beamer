+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The course starts from where Physics 11 left off with the study of   |
| motion. Students will explore dynamics, circular motion, energy,     |
| electricity and magnetism. The course requires a strong foundation   |
| in mathematics. The course emphasizes problem-solving and            |
| exploration.                                                         |

| ### English Language Strategies | - Various English language learning strategies will be embedded throughout the course. Some  |
|                                 |   of the common strategies and activities include:                                           |
|                                 |                                                                                              |
|                                 | - Vocabulary words will be highlighted and practiced by the students.                        |
|                                 |                                                                                              |
|                                 | - Assessments (formative and summative) will include vocabulary and language components to   |
|                                 |   support learning.                                                                          |
|                                 |                                                                                              |
|                                 | - Large summative language-based projects will be scaffolded with checkpoints to ensure      |
|                                 |   students have the linguistic capabilities to engage in the learning activities             |
|                                 |                                                                                              |
|                                 | - Students will have numerous opportunities to develop oral speaking skills through          |
|                                 |   structured activities such as discussions, think-pair-share, and group work working on     |
|                                 |   various mathematical concepts.                                                             |
|                                 |                                                                                              |
|                                 | - Materials provided will be supported by high quality visuals to connect the language to    |
|                                 |   ideas in an intuitive way.                                                                 |
|                                 |                                                                                              |
|                                 | - Lecture notes (as PowerPoint slides a heavily animated) will be available to students      |
|                                 |   online so that that can go though the material at their own pace.                          |
|                                 |                                                                                              |
|                                 | - I will work with the class to foster an open and safe environment that embiggens the       |
|                                 |   opportunities for each student to speak.                                                   |
+---------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ### Indigenous Learning         | - First People's principles will be embedded throughout the course. For example I will try   |
|                                 |   to make the learning process holistic, reflexive, reflective, experiential, and relational |
|                                 |   \[focused on connectedness, on reciprocal relationships, and a sense of place\];           |
|                                 |                                                                                              |
|                                 | - The class and I will strive to realize that learning involves patience and time. Also that |
|                                 |   learning is different for everyone.                                                        |
