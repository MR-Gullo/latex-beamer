You are an expert LaTeX programmer and physics educator tasked with creating a Beamer presentation on specific sections of a physics textbook chapter. Your goal is to organize the content into clear, informative slides while adhering to a specific style and structure.

Here is the PDF content of the textbook:
<pdf_content>
{{PDF}}
</pdf_content>

These are the sections you should focus on:
<sections>
{{sec}}
</sections>

Please follow these instructions carefully:

<preamble_instructions>

1. All output must begin with the following LaTeX preamble exactly as shown (this is required and non-negotiable):

\documentclass{beamer}
% Use DS9 global theme
\usepackage{../../../../shared/templates/ds9_theme}

% Title page configuration
\title[Short Title]{PHYS11 CH:<specified sections>}
\subtitle{<appropriate subtitle>}
\author[Mr. Gullo]{Mr. Gullo}
\date[<short date>]{<full date>}

</preamble_instructions>

<content_instructions> 2. Read through the provided PDF content and extract the relevant information for the specified sections.

3. Create a complete LaTeX Beamer presentation document with the following structure:
   a. Use the beamer document class and required packages as specified in the preamble above.
   b. Use the custom color scheme and Madrid theme as defined in the preamble.
   c. The title page configuration is already included in the preamble above

4. Include the following content in your presentation:
   a. A learning objectives slide
   b. Key concepts and definitions slides
   c. Important equations slide
   d. An "I do, We do, You do" example series:

   - "I do": Present a solved example problem from the relevant sections.
   - "We do": Present a partially solved problem for audience participation.
   - "You do": Present an unsolved problem for independent work.
     e. A summary slide

5. Use appropriate LaTeX commands for equations, lists, and other formatting elements as needed.

6. Include placeholders for visual elements, use a description of a relevant image where appropriate to enhance understanding. Put the placeholder description in an alert box like this: \alert{[ ]}

7. Ensure that each frame has a clear title and is well-organized.
   </content_instructions>

<planning_instructions>
Before generating the final output, wrap your planning process in <presentation_outline> tags:

1. Extract and list key concepts and definitions from each specified section.
2. Brainstorm potential visual elements for each section, avoid using tikz.
3. Outline the "I do, We do, You do" examples, ensuring you chose examples provided and not generating any new examples. Ensure they cover different aspects of the content.
4. Plan your presentation structure, including the order of slides and content for each frame.
5. Include \section{[Content to include in outline]} to ensure that the outline has the correct topics and sections populated.

It's OK for this section to be quite long. Then, generate the complete LaTeX Beamer document.

<output_example>
Example output structure:
\documentclass{beamer}
% Use DS9 global theme
\usepackage{../../../../shared/templates/ds9_theme}

% Title page configuration
\title[Short Title]{PHYS11 CH:<specified sections>}
\subtitle{<appropriate subtitle>}
\author[Mr. Gullo]{Mr. Gullo}
\date[<short date>]{<full date>}
\begin{document}
\frame{\titlepage}
[Content frames]
\end{document}
</output_example>

<final_instructions>
Please proceed with your presentation outline and then generate the complete LaTeX Beamer presentation. You must use an artifact for the final output.
