\small
\begin{itemize}
\item No saved copies of notebooks; zip folder empty or missing
\item No explanation given for why evidence is missing
\item Files submitted appear identical with no progression visible
\item Submits more than 3 days late without communication or does not submit at all
\end{itemize}

\small\itshape Some evidence provided but incomplete or hard to verify
\tcblower
\small
\begin{itemize}
\item Fewer than 4 notebook copies; missing evidence for some algorithms
\item Provides explanation for missing evidence but it is vague or unclear
\item Some progression visible but timestamps or random seeds don't show clear timeline
\item Submits 1--2 days late or last-minute; zip folder disorganized
\end{itemize}

%% PROFICIENT

{\large\bfseries\sffamily PROFICIENT}\\[2pt]
\small\itshape Clear evidence showing progression of independent work
\tcblower
\small
\begin{itemize}
\item 4+ notebook copies showing work at different stages for each algorithm
\item Different random seeds and test outputs show work done at different times
\item Clear progression from empty functions to working code with debugging visible
\item Submits on time as organized zip folder, communicates about any issues
\end{itemize}

%% EXTENDING
\begin{tcolorbox}[profbox, colback=extending!15, colframe=extending!60]
{\large\bfseries\sffamily EXTENDING}\\[2pt]
\small\itshape Excellent documentation of learning process and problem-solving
\tcblower
\small
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple saves per algorithm showing iterative debugging and improvement
\item Evidence includes failed attempts and how they were fixed
\item Files clearly named and organized (e.g., bubble, merge, quick)
\item Submits early with well-documented evidence; could explain their process if asked
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\vspace{4pt}
\noindent\small\textbf{Assessment Note:} Submit a zip folder with copies of your notebook saved at different stages of development. Ideally 4+ copies showing progression for each sorting algorithm. Different random seeds in the output help verify work was done at different times. If evidence is missing, include a written explanation.
