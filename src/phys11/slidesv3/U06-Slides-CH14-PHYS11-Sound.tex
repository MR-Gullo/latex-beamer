But all instruments arrive in sync, regardless of distance.

\pause

Since $\vel{v} = \freq{f}\wavelen{\lambda}$ and $\vel{v}$ is constant, higher \freq{frequency} means shorter \wavelen{wavelength}.

\textbf{Key insight:} $\intensity{I} \propto (\Delta p)^2$ where $\Delta p$ is pressure \amplitude{amplitude}.

\intensity{Intensity} is proportional to \amplitude{amplitude} squared!
