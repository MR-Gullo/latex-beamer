\begin{block}{Conservation of Charge}
\begin{center}
\Large $\boxed{q_{\text{initial}} = q_{\text{final}}}$
\end{center}
Electric charge cannot be created or destroyed.
\end{block}

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{exampleblock}{The Accounting Rule}
Charge is like money in a closed economy. It moves around, but the total never changes.
\end{exampleblock}
\note{[P0] [THE REVELATION] "Conservation of charge - one of the most fundamental laws in physics"\\\\
[ALGEBRA] "q-initial equals q-final"\\\\
- Charge cannot be created or destroyed\\\\
- Only transferred from one object to another\\\\
[P1] [THE CONNECTION - Digital Archetype] "Like a conservation law in a game engine - total resources constant, just redistributed"\\\\
[THE WONDER] This law has never been violated. Ever. In any experiment.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Attempt: Conservation Problem}
\textbf{Try this on your own (3 min, silent):}

Two metal spheres initially have $+4$ C and $+8$ C of charge. After they touch, the blue sphere has $+10$ C.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=0.3\textheight,keepaspectratio]{phys11-electric-charge-fig12.jpg}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Initial: blue $= +4$ C, red $= +8$ C
\item Final: blue $= +10$ C
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Find:} Final charge on red sphere

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textit{Work individually. It's okay to get stuck.}
\note{[THE CHALLENGE] Can you find the missing charge using conservation?\\\\
[TIMING] 3-4 min SILENT individual work\\\\

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Compare: Conservation Problem}
\textbf{Turn and talk (2 min):}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Share your approach with your partner
\item What equation did you use?
\item How did you solve for the red sphere's charge?
\end{enumerate}

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}
\alert{Name wheel:} One pair share your approach (not your answer).
\note{- 2-3 min pair discussion\\\\
- Circulate and listen for approaches\\\\
- Name wheel: call a pair to share\\\\
- Listen for: did they use q-initial equals q-final?\\\\
- EXPECTED APPROACH: total before equals total after, solve for q-red\\\\
[THE CONNECTION] This is accounting - track where charge goes}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reveal: Solution}
\textbf{Self-correct in a different color:}

\textbf{Strategy:} Use conservation of charge

\pause
$$q_{\text{initial}} = q_{\text{final}}$$

\pause
$$+4 \text{ C} + 8 \text{ C} = +10 \text{ C} + q_{\text{red}}$$

\pause
$$+12 \text{ C} = +10 \text{ C} + q_{\text{red}}$$

\pause
$$\boxed{q_{\text{red}} = +2 \text{ C}}$$

\pause
\textbf{Check:} Total before = $+12$ C. Total after = $+10 + 2 = +12$ C. ✓
\note{- Walk through solution step by step\\\\
[P0] [ALGEBRA] "Conservation: q-initial equals q-final"\\\\
[P1] "Initial total: 4 plus 8 equals 12 coulombs"\\\\
[P2] "Final total: 10 plus q-red"\\\\
[P3] "Set them equal: 12 equals 10 plus q-red"\\\\
[P4] "Solve: q-red equals 2 coulombs"\\\\
[P5] "Check: 10 plus 2 equals 12. Conservation satisfied."\\\\
[ANSWER] q-red equals plus 2 coulombs\\\\

\section{Conductors and Insulators}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{18.1 Materials That Conduct}
\begin{block}{Conductor vs. Insulator}
\textbf{Conductor:} Charge moves easily (metals, copper, aluminum)\\
\textbf{Insulator:} Charge cannot move (rubber, plastic, glass)
\end{block}

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{exampleblock}{The Mental Model}
Conductors are like highways - electrons flow freely. Insulators are like walls - electrons stuck in place.
\end{exampleblock}
\note{[P0] [THE REVELATION] "Materials classified by ability to conduct charge"\\\\
- Conductors: metals with loosely bound outer electrons\\\\
- Charge moves easily through conductors\\\\
- Insulators: electrons held tightly to atoms\\\\
- Charge cannot move through insulators\\\\
[P1] [THE CONNECTION - Kinetic Archetype] "Like traffic - conductors are open roads, insulators are blocked"\\\\
[THE WONDER] Semiconductors (silicon) can be switched between conducting and insulating - that's how computer chips work}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{18.1 The Conductivity Scale}

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=0.6\textheight,keepaspectratio]{phys11-electric-charge-fig14-1.jpg}
\end{figure}

\pause
Resistivity measures how hard it is to move charge. Lower = better conductor.
\note{[P0] "Scale from conductors to semiconductors to insulators"\\\\
- Silver, copper: best conductors (lowest resistivity)\\\\
- Silicon: semiconductor (middle ground)\\\\
- Glass, rubber: insulators (highest resistivity)\\\\
[P1] "Note: scale is NOT linear - huge gaps between categories"\\\\
[THE CONNECTION - Digital Archetype] Semiconductors are the foundation of all digital technology - we control whether they conduct or insulate}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,height=0.5\textheight,keepaspectratio]{phys11-electric-charge-fig14.jpg}
\end{figure}

\pause
\textbf{Conductor:} Charge spreads to outer surface (repulsion)\\
\textbf{Insulator:} Charge stays where placed (cannot move)
\note{[P0] "Add excess negative charge to conductor vs insulator"\\\\
- Panel a: conductor - electrons repel, spread to outer surface\\\\
- Panel b: insulator - electrons cannot move, stay put\\\\
[P1] [THE CONFLICT] "Like charges repel in BOTH cases, but only conductors allow movement"\\\\
[THE WONDER] This is why static shock happens - charge builds on insulator (your shoes), then suddenly transfers through conductor (your hand)}
\end{frame}

\section{Transfer of Charge}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{18.1 Three Ways to Charge}
\begin{alertblock}{Key Insight}
Only \alert{negative} charge (electrons) moves in solids.\\
Protons are stuck in nuclei.
\end{alertblock}

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Three methods:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Contact:} Rubbing transfers electrons \pause
\item \textbf{Conduction:} Touching transfers charge \pause
\item \textbf{Induction:} Charge separation without touching
\end{itemize}
\note{[P0] [THE REVELATION] "Critical: only electrons move in solids"\\\\
- Protons stuck in nucleus, atoms stuck in place\\\\
- Electrons can jump between atoms\\\\
[P1] "Charging by contact: rub carpet, electrons transfer to shoes"\\\\
[P2] "Charging by conduction: touch doorknob, electrons jump"\\\\
[P3] "Charging by induction: nearby charge causes separation"\\\\
[THE WONDER] All of electronics based on controlled electron movement}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{18.1 Charging by Contact}
\textbf{Example:} Walk across carpet on dry day

\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Shoes rub carpet \pause
\item Electrons transfer from carpet to shoes \pause
\item You gain excess negative charge \pause
\item Touch doorknob - \alert{ZAP!} Electrons transfer to doorknob
\end{itemize}

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{exampleblock}{Real-World}
This is why you get shocked more on dry days. Humid air conducts charge away before buildup.
\end{exampleblock}
\note{[P0] "Classic static shock scenario"\\\\
[P1] "Shoes rub carpet - friction brings surfaces close"\\\\
[P2] "Electrons transfer from carpet to shoes - now you have excess negative"\\\\
[P3] "Excess electrons spread over your body (repulsion)"\\\\
[P4] "Touch metal doorknob - electrons jump to doorknob. ZAP!"\\\\
[THE CONNECTION - Kinetic Archetype] "Every step is friction - same as sliding down slide"\\\\
[THE HUMILITY] Humidity prevents this - water molecules in air conduct charge away}
\end{frame}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,height=0.45\textheight,keepaspectratio]{phys11-electric-charge-fig16.jpg}
\end{figure}

\pause
\textbf{Top:} 100 electrons touch 50 electrons $\rightarrow$ charge equalizes to 75 each\\
\textbf{Bottom:} 100 protons touch 50 protons $\rightarrow$ electrons flow opposite direction
\note{[P0] "Conduction: charge transfer by direct contact"\\\\
- Top row: sphere with 100 excess electrons touches sphere with 50\\\\
- Electrons redistribute: 25 transfer, both end with 75\\\\
[P1] "Bottom row: sphere with 100 excess protons touches 50 excess protons"\\\\
- Actually electrons flow OTHER way: 25 electrons transfer to first sphere\\\\
- Cancels 25 protons, leaving 75 excess each\\\\
[THE REVELATION] Net effect same, but only electrons actually move in solids}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{18.1 Polarization}
\begin{block}{Electric Polarization}
Charge separation within an object, creating positive region and negative region.\\
\textbf{Net charge still zero.}
\end{block}

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Example:} Child on slide (Figure 18.1)
\begin{itemize}
\item Excess positive charge on body
\item Positive charges repel each other
\item Spread to extremities (hair)
\item Hair strands repel $\rightarrow$ stand on end!
\end{itemize}
\note{[P0] [THE REVELATION] "Polarization: charge separates but total charge remains zero"\\\\
- Not creating charge, just pushing it around\\\\
[P1] "Child on slide: excess positive charge from friction"\\\\
- Positive charges repel each other\\\\
- Spread to extremities: hands, feet, hair\\\\
- Each hair strand has excess positive\\\\
- Strands repel each other - hair stands on end\\\\
[THE WONDER] This is temporary - charge leaks away to air, especially if humid}

Charge objects \textit{without touching} by separating charge with nearby charged rod.
\note{[P0] "Induction: charging without contact"\\\\
- Panel a: two neutral spheres touching\\\\
- Panel b: bring positive rod near (don't touch)\\\\
- Negative charge attracted, positive repelled\\\\
- Panel c: separate spheres while rod nearby\\\\
- Panel d: remove rod - spheres now oppositely charged\\\\
[P1] [THE REVELATION] "Never touched, yet charged. Opposite charges attract, so they cluster near rod"\\\\
[THE WONDER] This is how you can charge objects without losing charge from the rod}

\textbf{How it works:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Belt carries charge from lower comb to upper comb
\item Charge spreads to outer surface of metal globe
\item Can accumulate millions of volts!

Touch the globe $\rightarrow$ excess charge spreads over body $\rightarrow$ hair stands on end!
\note{[P0] "Classic demonstration - person touching Van de Graaff generator"\\\\
- Charge transfers from globe to person\\\\
- Spreads over body to extremities\\\\
