\section*{EMERGING}
\textit{Beginning to grasp fundamental concepts of experimental documentation, requiring significant guidance with frequent procedural and theoretical gaps.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Submits work more than 3 days late without communication, uses incorrect file formats, and leaves significant work incomplete
\item Misunderstands core theory or fails to follow required procedures, producing unreliable data
\item Captures basic equipment photos and group portrait with minimal attention to composition
\item Documents experimental steps with inconsistent detail or focus
\item Shows limited awareness of scale references and environmental context
\end{itemize}

\section*{DEVELOPING}
\textit{Shows growing understanding of documentation principles with minor procedural errors, needs support in execution.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Submits 1-2 days late or requests last-minute extensions while generally following format requirements and completing most work, though it may be rushed
\item Follows most procedures correctly but shows incomplete theoretical understanding affecting some data quality
\item Creates clear equipment photos and group portrait with basic compositional awareness
\item Records major experimental transitions with adequate detail
\item Includes basic scale references and some environmental context
\end{itemize}

\section*{PROFICIENT}
\textit{Demonstrates solid comprehension of documentation methods, working independently with correct procedures.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Submits on time with proper formatting, communicates about potential delays, and completes all components thoroughly
\item Demonstrates sound theoretical understanding and follows procedures correctly, collecting reliable data
\item Produces well-composed equipment photos and engaged group portrait
\item Captures complete experimental progression with appropriate detail
\item Effectively integrates scale references and environmental context
\end{itemize}

\section*{EXTENDING}
\textit{Shows advanced understanding and creative capability in documentation with exceptional theoretical application.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Submits quality work ahead of deadlines, maintains clear communication, prepares well for known absences, and creates systems for tracking requirements
\item Shows deep theoretical insight and adapts procedures thoughtfully when needed, ensuring high-quality data
\item Creates compelling visual narrative through thoughtful composition and sequencing
\item Documents subtle experimental details and transitional moments
\item Innovatively incorporates context and scale while maintaining technical precision
\end{itemize}
