# Physics 11 Slides Build Errors

## ch01-03_review_test-prep.tex ✅ FIXED

### Previously Missing Files (Now Resolved)
- **Line 88-92**: Reference frame images → Fixed with `phys11-motion-reference_frames_example1.png` and `phys11-motion-reference_frames_example2.png`
- **Line 130**: Velocity-time graph → Fixed with `phys11-kinematics-velocity-time-displacement-graph.png` (copied from `src/phys11/Workspace11/image.png`)

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Compilation**: Successful (22 pages, 3MB with images)
- **Image references**: All resolved
- **PDF generation**: Complete

## Other Files

### Common Issues Across Files
- Missing image dependencies
- Image path resolution issues

## Build Status Summary
- **Total files attempted**: 18
- **Files with critical errors**: Reduced (ch01-03_review_test-prep.tex now fixed)
- **Successfully built**: ch01-03_review_test-prep.tex + files without image dependencies
- **Remaining issues**: Other files may still have missing image dependencies

## Recommended Fixes
1. **Image Management**:
   - Verify all image files exist in expected locations
   - Update image paths to use the standardized `\graphicspath` from DS9 theme
   - Move images to `/shared/images/` directory as per project structure

2. **File Structure**:
   - Ensure images are in `../images/` or `../../shared/images/` relative to slides
   - Update any hardcoded image paths

3. **Previously Missing Images (Now Available)**:
   - ✅ `Screenshot 2024-10-11 141024.png` → `phys11-screenshots-test-prep-141024.png` (in images directory)
   - ✅ `Screenshot 2024-10-11 141044.png` → `phys11-screenshots-test-prep-141044.png` (in images directory)  
   - ✅ `2024_09_22_d75bb9ada91612339d1ag-12.jpg` → Found as `image.png` in `src/phys11/Workspace11/` and copied

## Next Steps
- ✅ **ch01-03_review_test-prep.tex**: Complete - all images located and restored
- **Remaining files**: Apply similar fixes to other LaTeX files with missing images
- **Future builds**: Use proper image naming convention from `newnames.md`

## Notes
- Images are available in `src/phys11/images/` with proper naming conventions
- Check `src/phys11/Workspace11/` for additional missing images
- Use `src/phys11/images/newnames.md` as reference for image availability
