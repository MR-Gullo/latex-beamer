\title{\textbf{Special Relativity: Song \& Music Video Project}}
\author{Physics 12}
\date{}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Overview}
You will work in groups of 5 to create an original song about a relativistic scenario using AI music generation tools, or your own musical skills then produce a music video that demonstrates the physics through visuals.

\textbf{Crucial Note:} While the song and video are collaborative group efforts, the mathematical derivation and conceptual explanation will be assessed \textbf{individually} during an in-class analysis session. Your group's goal is to ensure \textit{every member} understands the physics deep enough to derive it on their own.

\section{Project Phases \& Checklist}
\textit{This project will span approximately 3 weeks. Specific due dates for each phase will be posted in class.}

\subsection*{Phase 1: Setup \& Derivation (Pre-Production)}
\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$]
    \item \textbf{Group Formation \& Topic Assignment:} Receive your specific relativistic scenario.
    \item \textbf{Initial AI Exploration:} Experiment with AI music tools (Suno, Udio or alternatives) to find a genre and style.
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Calculation Session:} Work through the math \textbf{together}. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Example Goal:} Every member must be able to derive the $\gamma$ factor and relevant time/length changes on scratch paper without looking at notes.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Teacher Checkpoint 1:} During class, the teacher will ask one random member from each group to derive $\gamma$ on scratch paper. Groups are cleared to proceed once a member passes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Phase 2: Production \& Data Visualization}
\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$]
    \item \textbf{Song Finalization:} Generate the final audio track and transcribe lyrics.
    \item \textbf{Visual Storyboarding:} Plan how you will visualize the paradox (split screens, props, etc.).
    \item \textbf{Filming:} Record all video segments. Ensure all group members appear on camera.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Phase 3: Mastery \& Editing}
\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$]
    \item \textbf{Video Editing:} Assemble clips and sync audio.
    \item \textbf{Tip:} Quiz each other before Part 3 — if someone can't explain the paradox, help them now. Their grade depends on it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Phase 4: Assessment}
\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$]
    \item \textbf{Part 3: Individual In-Class Analysis:} A standalone pen-and-paper assessment (see details below).
    \item \textbf{Final Submission:} Upload Song, Lyrics, and Final Video files.
    \item \textbf{Showcase:} Class screening of music videos.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assignment Components}

\subsection{Part 1: AI-Generated Song (15 points)}
\textit{Group Component}

Use an AI music generation tool or work with your musical peers to create a 2--4 minute song in your chosen genre that tells the story of your relativistic scenario.

\subsubsection*{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Accuracy:} Lyrics must accurately describe the specific paradox or scenario.
    \item \textbf{Narrative:} Song should follow a structure: Setup $\rightarrow$ Conflict (Paradox) $\rightarrow$ Resolution.
    \item \textbf{Submission:} MP3/WAV file + Text file of lyrics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Part 2: Music Video (45 points)}
\textit{Group Component}

Create a 4--6 minute music video. Unlike previous years, you do \textbf{not} need to show every step of algebra on screen (that will be done in Part 3). Instead, use the video to visualize the \textit{results} and the \textit{concepts}.

\subsubsection*{Required Video Elements:}

\textbf{1. Visuals (35 points)}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Visualize the paradox. Show us \textit{why} the observers disagree.
    \item Use creative methods: split-screens, props (rulers, clocks), or animations to represent length contraction and time dilation.
    \item Optional: Add on-screen text or graphics showing key values — but this is not required.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Production \& Creativity (10 points)}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Audio clarity (song must be audible).
    \item All group members must appear on camera.
    \item Editing coherence and creativity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Part 3: Individual In-Class Analysis (40 points)}
\textit{Individual Component -- Date TBD by Teacher}

To ensure academic integrity and individual understanding, the mathematical rigor will be assessed via an in-class write-up. You will not have access to your video or AI tools during this session.

\subsubsection*{The Format:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Time: 45--60 minutes.
    \item Materials Allowed: Scientific calculator, provided "Universal Formula Sheet" (standard constants and Lorentz formulas).
    \item Materials NOT Allowed: Pre-written notes, phones, AI.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{The Task:}
You will be given the specific initial variables from your group's chosen topic (e.g., "Your group studied the Twin Paradox with $v=0.9c$"). You must:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Derive the Algebra:} Starting from the universal formulas, show the algebraic steps to solve for the specific values (time, length, velocity) relevant to your scenario.
    \item \textbf{Calculate Values:} Plug in the numbers to find the exact values used in your video.
    \item \textbf{Explain the Paradox:} In 1-2 paragraphs, explain \textit{why} the paradox occurs and how it is resolved, referencing the calculations you just performed.
    \item \textbf{Spacetime/Diagrams:} Draw a spacetime diagram or relevant sketch illustrating the reference frames.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Group Strategy: How to Prepare}

Since 40\% of your grade is individual, your group must function as a \textbf{study team}. You cannot assign "The Math Person" to do the math while "The Art Person" makes the video. If you do that, "The Art Person" will fail Part 3.

\textbf{Suggested Workflow:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Calculation:} Early in Phase 1, sit together and solve the problem. Do not move on until \textit{every} member can explain why $\gamma$ is calculated that way.
    \item \textbf{Peer Teaching:} During the video planning, quiz each other. "Hey, why does the ship's clock show less time? Show me the math."
    \item \textbf{The "Scratch Paper Test":} Before the individual assessment, have each group member derive the solution from scratch on paper while the others watch and correct them.
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Six Topics}

\textit{(Refer to the separate Topic Guide for specific variable values and scenarios)}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Twin Paradox:} $v=0.90c$, $d=4.3$ ly.
