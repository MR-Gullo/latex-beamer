\section{Linear Momentum and Impulse}

\begin{frame}

\begin{block}{By the end of this section, you will be able to:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{8.1:} Describe momentum, impulse, and the impulse-momentum theorem \pause
\item \textbf{8.1:} Express Newton's second law in terms of momentum \pause
\item \textbf{8.1:} Solve problems using the impulse-momentum theorem
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{8.1 Mass in Motion}
\begin{block}{The Universal Law: Momentum}
\begin{center}
\Large $\boxed{\vec{p} = m\vec{v}}$
\end{center}
Momentum equals mass times velocity. The quantity of motion.
\end{block}

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Key insights:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Directly proportional to mass and velocity \pause
\item Vector - same direction as velocity \pause
\item SI unit: $\text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}$
\end{itemize}
\note{[P0] [THE REVELATION] "Momentum is mass in motion - p equals m v"\\\\
[P1] "Greater mass or greater speed means greater momentum"\\\\
[P2] "Vector quantity - direction matters"\\\\
[P3] "Units: kilograms times meters per second"\\\\
[THE WONDER] Newton called this the quantity of motion}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{8.1 The Civilian's Mistake}
\begin{alertblock}{Civilian View vs. Reality}
\textbf{Civilian:} "Speed is all that matters in a collision."\\
\textbf{Physicist:} "Mass matters just as much as velocity."
\end{alertblock}

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}

\begin{exampleblock}{The Mental Model}
A slow-moving truck can have more momentum than a fast-moving bicycle.\\
Why? Mass wins.
\end{exampleblock}
\note{[P0] [THE CONFLICT] "Civilians think only speed matters"\\\\
[P1] [THE CONNECTION - Kinetic Archetype] "Think about getting hit by a slow truck versus a fast tennis ball"\\\\
- Truck wins every time\\\\
- Both mass AND velocity matter\\\\
[THE HUMILITY] Our intuition misleads us}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{8.1 Newton's Hidden Truth}
\begin{block}{The Original Second Law}
\begin{center}
\Large $\boxed{\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{\Delta\vec{p}}{\Delta t}}$
\end{center}
Net force equals the rate of change of momentum.
\end{block}

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}

This is actually MORE fundamental than $F = ma$.

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Why?} This version works even when mass changes (like rockets burning fuel).
\note{[P0] [THE REVELATION] "Newton actually wrote his second law in terms of momentum"\\\\
[P1] "F equals m a is just a special case for constant mass"\\\\
[P2] "This version works for rockets, which lose mass as they burn fuel"\\\\
[THE WONDER] The universe speaks in momentum, not acceleration}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{8.1 The Force of Time}
\begin{block}{The Universal Law: Impulse}
\begin{center}
\Large $\boxed{J = \vec{F}_{\text{net}}\Delta t = \Delta\vec{p}}$
\end{center}
Impulse equals force times time equals change in momentum.
\end{block}

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Key insight:} A small force over long time $=$ Large force over short time

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}

\begin{exampleblock}{In the Real World}
Airbags increase collision time $\rightarrow$ decrease force on your body.
\end{exampleblock}
\note{[P0] [THE REVELATION] "Impulse: J equals F times delta t equals change in momentum"\\\\
[P1] "Same momentum change can happen with small force over long time or large force over short time"\\\\
[P2] "Airbags work by increasing the collision time, which decreases the force"\\\\

\textbf{Physics:} $\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{\Delta\vec{p}}{\Delta t}$

Increase $\Delta t$ $\rightarrow$ Decrease $\vec{F}_{\text{net}}$
\note{[Fig 8.2: Deployed airbag with person in seatbelt] "Critical teaching moment: Airbag extends collision time from ~5ms (dashboard) to ~30ms. Ask students to calculate force reduction ratio (6x safer). Connect to F=Δp/Δt algebraically."\\\\

\begin{alertblock}{The Challenge}
Your friend dares you to jump off a bench without bending your knees.\\

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Answer:} Bending knees increases $\Delta t$, which decreases $F$.

\pause
\vspace{0.3cm}

\begin{exampleblock}{The Mental Model}
Stiff legs: short collision time $\rightarrow$ HUGE force on bones.\\
Bent knees: long collision time $\rightarrow$ smaller force, no injury.

\textbf{Conservation:} $m_1\vec{v}_1 + m_2\vec{v}_2 = m_1\vec{v}'_1 + m_2\vec{v}'_2$
\note{[Fig 8.4: Before/after diagram of two cars, showing velocity vectors v₁, v₂, v₁', v₂'] "Use this to introduce vector subscript notation systematically.

\textbf{Angular momentum:} $\vec{L} = I\vec{\omega}$

\textbf{Conservation:} $I_1\omega_1 = I_2\omega_2$

Decrease $I$ (pull arms in) $\rightarrow$ Increase $\omega$ (spin faster)

[P1] "L equals I omega - moment of inertia times angular velocity"\\\\

\textbf{Strategy:} Break into components.

\textbf{$x$-direction:} $m_1v_1 = m_1v'_1\cos\theta_1 + m_2v'_2\cos\theta_2$

\textbf{$y$-direction:} $0 = m_1v'_1\sin\theta_1 + m_2v'_2\sin\theta_2$

Note m₂ initially at rest simplifies y-equation to zero."\\\\

\begin{block}{The Revelations}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Momentum $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$ - mass in motion \pause
\item Impulse $J = \vec{F}\Delta t = \Delta\vec{p}$ - force over time changes momentum \pause
\item Newton's second law: $\vec{F} = \Delta\vec{p}/\Delta t$ - the original form \pause
\item Conservation: $\vec{p}_{\text{tot}} = \text{constant}$ in isolated systems \pause
\item Elastic collisions: objects bounce, KE conserved \pause
\item Inelastic collisions: objects stick, KE lost \pause
\item Momentum ALWAYS conserved (if isolated)

\begin{align}
\vec{p} &= m\vec{v} \\
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} &= \frac{\Delta\vec{p}}{\Delta t} \\
J &= \vec{F}_{\text{net}}\Delta t = \Delta\vec{p} \\
\vec{p}_{\text{tot}} &= \text{constant (isolated system)} \\
m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 &= m_1v'_1 + m_2v'_2 \text{ (elastic)} \\
m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 &= (m_1 + m_2)v' \text{ (inelastic)}
