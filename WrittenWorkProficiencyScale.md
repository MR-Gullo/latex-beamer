EMERGING Beginning to develop basic problem-solving structure across multiple problems
Lists some given information randomly across problems
Attempts basic sketches inconsistently
Writes equations without explanation in most responses
Shows scattered calculations throughout
Often forgets units across problems

DEVELOPING Shows growing understanding of solution structure across the test
Organizes given information with some gaps in most problems
Creates labeled diagrams in some responses
Selects relevant equations for most problems
Shows work in sequence for majority of problems
Uses units sometimes across responses

PROFICIENT Demonstrates clear, systematic problem-solving consistently
Lists all knowns and unknowns clearly in most problems
