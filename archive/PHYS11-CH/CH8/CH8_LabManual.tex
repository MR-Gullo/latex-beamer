\section*{Experimental Overview}

\textbf{Key Concept}:\\
Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity, expressed mathematically as: $$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$$

In this investigation, you'll analyze the momentum of sports equipment in motion, connecting classroom physics to real-world athletics. By capturing slow-motion video of sports equipment in action, you'll discover how mass and velocity combine to create the dynamic interactions we see in sports.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=conceptgreen!10,colframe=conceptgreen,title=\textbf{Investigation Strategy}]
Choose a sport where an object's momentum plays a crucial role. Excellent choices include:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Frisbee catch
\item A soccer ball being kicked
\item A volleyball serve
\item A basketball jump shot
\item A Badminton serve
\end{itemize}
Consider which motion will be easiest to capture clearly on video while also being safe to measure.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Materials and Equipment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Smartphone with video capability (120fps or higher recommended but not needed)
\item Electric balance (accurate to at least 0.1g)
\item Measuring tape or meter stick
\item Your chosen sports equipment
\item Spreadsheet software
\item Ruler (for measuring distances on video playback)
\item Reference object of known size (for video scale calibration)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Safety Considerations}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=safetyyellow!30,colframe=safetyyellow!80,title=\textbf{Safety Protocol}]
Before beginning your investigation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choose a safe, open area appropriate for your sport
\item Ensure no people or valuable objects are in the path of your sports equipment
\item Follow all standard safety procedures for your chosen sport
\item Have a spotter present during measurements and filming
\item Secure loose clothing and remove jewelry that could interfere with movement
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Experimental Procedure}

\subsection*{Part 1: Mass Measurement}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\item Use the electric balance to measure your sports object's mass in kilograms
\item Record this value with appropriate significant figures
\item Measure and record any relevant dimensions of your object
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part 2: Velocity Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\item Place your reference object (of known size) in the same plane as your intended motion
\item Record your sports action in slow motion (try to keep the camera perpendicular to the motion)
\item Repeat for at least 5 measurements
\item Transfer the video to a computer for analysis

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Video Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\item Count the total frames for your object's motion
\item Note your camera's frame rate (frames per second)
\item Use your reference object to establish scale in the video
\item Measure the distance your object travels
\item Calculate velocity using: $$v = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{number of frames}/\text{frames per second}}$$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=labblue!5,colframe=labblue,title=\textbf{Sample Calculation}]
Let's analyze a basketball free throw:

Given:
\begin{itemize}
\item Distance traveled: 4.2 meters (from player to hoop)
\item Number of frames: 30 frames
\item Camera frame rate: 240 frames per second
\end{itemize}

Time interval = $\frac{30 \text{ frames}}{240 \text{ frames/second}} = 0.125 \text{ seconds}$

Velocity = $\frac{4.2 \text{ meters}}{0.125 \text{ seconds}} = 33.6 \text{ meters/second}$

If the basketball's mass is 0.62 kg, its momentum would be:

Momentum = $0.62 \text{ kg} \times 33.6 \text{ m/s} = 20.8 \text{ kg}\cdot\text{m/s}$

\textit{Note: This example illustrates why precision in measurement is crucial - small errors in distance or frame counting can significantly affect your final momentum calculation.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Data Collection}
Record your measurements in this format:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
Measurement & Value & Units \\
\midrule
Object Mass & & kg \\
Distance Traveled & & m \\
Frame Count & & frames \\
Time Interval & & s \\
Calculated Velocity & & m/s \\
Calculated Momentum & & kgâ‹…m/s \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=conceptgreen!10,colframe=conceptgreen,title=\textbf{Video Recording Best Practices}]
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the highest frame rate available
\item Keep the camera steady (tripod recommended)
\item Ensure good lighting
\item Position the camera perpendicular to the motion
\item Include a reference object of known size in the frame
\item Record multiple trials
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Analysis Questions}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\item How does your object's momentum compare to other sports? Research typical values for comparison.
\item What factors might affect the accuracy of your measurements?
\item How might air resistance impact your results?
\item Why is momentum important in your chosen sport?
\item How could your measurement technique be improved?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Additional Insights}
Consider how momentum conservation applies in your sport. For example, in a collision between a bat and baseball, total momentum is conserved even as it transfers between objects. How does this principle manifest in your chosen sport?

\textit{Optional Extension}: Compare the momentum of different techniques in your sport (e.g., different types of serves in tennis or different types of kicks in soccer).
