Slide 22: image22.jpg -> phys11-what-is-physics-fig1-20.jpg
  Alt: A plastic pen cap is sitting on a digital scale and has a measured mass of 0.98 grams.
Slide 23: image23.jpg -> phys11-what-is-physics-fig1-21.jpg
  Alt: A red target is shown with four dots that are spread out around the outer center ring, or bull's eye. The dots represent attempts by a GPS system to locate a restaurant at the center of the bull’s-eye. The dots are spread out quite far apart from one another, indicating low precision, but they are each rather close to the actual location of the restaurant, indicating high accuracy.
Slide 24: image24.jpg -> phys11-what-is-physics-fig1-22.jpg
  Alt: A red target is shown with four dots that represent attempts by a GPS system to locate a restaurant at the center of the bull’s-eye. The dots are concentrated close to one another, indicating high precision, but they are rather far away from the actual location of the restaurant, indicating low accuracy.
Slide 25: image25.jpg -> phys11-what-is-physics-fig1-23.jpg
  Alt: A red target is shown with four dots that represent attempts by a GPS system to locate a restaurant at the center of the bull’s-eye. The dots are concentrated close to one another, indicating high precision, and they are very close to the actual location of the restaurant, indicating high accuracy.
Slide 26: image26.jpg -> phys11-what-is-physics-fig1-24.jpg

The y-axis is labeled Distance from station in kilometers and has a scale from zero to one hundred sixty in increments of twenty. The following points are plotted along the trend line: zero, zero; ten, twenty-two; twenty, thirty-eight; thirty, sixty; forty, eighty-two; fifty, ninety-eight; sixty, one-hundred eighteen; seventy, one-hundred forty.
Slide 30: image30.jpg -> phys11-what-is-physics-fig1-28.jpg
  Alt: Four line graphs are shown. All graphs have x-axis and y-axis scales from zero to ten in increments of two. Graph a is a linear relationship between x and y, where y equals m times x plus b, with a positive and a negative slope shown. Graph b is a quadratic relationship where y equals a times x squared plus b x plus c. The line curves upward. Graph c is a an inverse relationship where y equals a over x. The line curves downward. And graph d is an exponential relationship where y equals a to the power of x and the line curves upward, and where y equals a to the negative power of x and the line curves downward.
Slide 31: image31.jpg -> phys11-what-is-physics-fig1-29.jpg
  Alt: Two line graphs are shown. Graph a shows a graphical representation the Richter scale and uses a log base 10 scale on its y-axis in microns of amplified maximum ground motion. The x-axis has a scale from negative one through nine and indicates categories of earthquakes. Negative one to two is categorized as “Not felt.” Two to four is “Minor”, four to five is “Small”, five to six is “Moderate”, six to seven is “Strong”, seven to eight is “Major”, and above eight is “Great.” Graph b shows the relationship between the frequency and wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, plotted as a straight line using a log-log plot. The x-axis is labeled Wavelength in centimeters and has a scale from ten to the power of negative six through ten to the power of negative eight. The y-axis is labeled Frequency with units in s to the power of negative one. Using these units, the y-axis scale is from ten to the power of sixteen through ten to the power of nineteen. The plotted line shows an inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength.
