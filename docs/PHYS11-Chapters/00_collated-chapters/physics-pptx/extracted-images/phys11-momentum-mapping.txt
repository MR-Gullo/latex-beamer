  Alt: Revise alt text to: An illustration shows before and after diagrams of two cars, one in front of the other. The car in the back is labeled m one and the car in the front is labeled m two. Both diagrams are labeled System of Interest. In the before diagram, a velocity vector points from the car in the back to the car in the front. A second velocity vector of equal magnitude points from the car in the front to the right. Two equations are shown: p one plus p two equals p total and net F equals zero. In the after diagram, the velocity vector pointing from the car in the back is shorter. The velocity vector pointing from the car in the front is longer. They are labeled v one prime and v two prime. The equation p one prime plus p two prime equals p total is shown.

  Alt: An illustration shows an ice skater in two positions. She is spinning on the tip of her skate with her arms extended in the first position. In the second position, her arms are pulled in as she is spinning. In the first position, an arrow labeled w shows the direction of her spin and the equation L equals I times w is shown. In the second position, an arrow labeled w prime shows the direction of her spin and the equation L equals I prime times w prime is shown.

  Alt: An illustration shows before and after diagrams of two boxes moving toward each other on a frictionless surface. The box on the left is labeled m one and the box on the right is labeled m two. Both diagrams are labeled System of Interest. In the before diagram, a velocity vector, v one, points from m one toward m two. A second, shorter velocity vector, v two, points from the left side of m two toward m one. Two equations are shown: p one plus p one equals p total and net F equals zero. In the after diagram, both velocity vectors point away from each mass, m one and m two. The vector on the left is shorter than the one on the right. The equation p one prime plus p one prime equals p total is shown.

  Alt: An illustration shows before and after diagrams of two boxes moving toward each other on a frictionless surface. Both boxes are labeled m. Both diagrams are labeled System of Interest. In the before diagram, a velocity vector, v, points from the left box to the right box. A second vector of equal magnitude, negative v, points from right box toward the left box. Two equations are shown: p one plus p two equals zero and net F equals zero. In the after diagram, the boxes are touching. The equations p one prime plus p two prime equals zero and v equals zero are shown.

  Alt: An illustration shows before and after diagrams of two balls, one moving toward the other. The first ball is labeled m one and the second ball is labeled m two. Both diagrams are labeled System of Interest, but the diagram on the left specifies before collision and the diagram on the right specifies after collision. In the before diagram, a velocity vector, v one, points from m one to m two. The following are also shown: v two equals zero, net F equals zero, and p one equals p total. In the after diagram, m one is moving in an upward direction and m two is moving in a downward direction. Vectors labeled v one prime and v two prime show their directional movements. M one and m two are shown forming angles with the x-axis. The equation p one prime plus p one prime equals p total is shown.

  Alt: An illustration shows before and after diagrams of a hockey puck and an ice hockey player on a frictionless ice surface. The hockey puck is labeled m one and the hockey player is labeled m two. Both diagrams are labeled System of Interest. In the before diagram, a velocity vector, v one, points from the puck to the player. The following are shown: p one equals p total, v two equals zero, and net F equals zero. In the after diagram, the hockey puck has made contact with the player. A velocity vector, v prime, points from the hockey player to the right. The equation p one prime plus p two prime equals p total is shown. The equation v one prime plus v two prime equals v prime is also shown.
Slide 12: image12.jpg -> phys11-momentum-fig8-10.jpg
  Alt: An illustration shows before and after diagrams of two carts moving toward each other on a frictionless surface. The cart on the left is labeled m one and the car on the right is labeled m two. Both diagrams are labeled System of Interest. In the before diagram, a velocity vector, v one, points from the cart on the left to the cart on the right. A second, shorter velocity vector, v two, points from the cart on the right to the cart on the left. Two equations are shown: p one plus p one equals p total and net F equals zero. In the after diagram, the velocity vectors are equal in magnitude and point away from the carts. They are labeled v one prime and v two prime. The equation p one prime plus p one prime equals p total is shown.

  Alt: An illustration shows before and after diagrams of two balls, one moving toward the other. The first ball is labeled m one and the second ball is labeled m two and point four kilograms. In the before diagram, a velocity vector, v one, points from m one to m two. In the after diagram, m one is moving in an upward direction with a velocity vector, v one prime, indicating its direction. It forms an angle of forty-five degrees with the x-axis. The following are also shown: before, p one equal p total; after, prime plus p two prime equals p total; net F equals zero; v two equals zero; v two prime is unknown; angle two is unknown.
