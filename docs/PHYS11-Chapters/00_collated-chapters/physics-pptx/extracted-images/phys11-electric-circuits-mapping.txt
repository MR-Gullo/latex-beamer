Slide 3: image3.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-1.jpg
  Alt: Water is shown flowing through a hydroelectric facility.
Slide 4: image4.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-2.jpg
  Alt: Electrons move from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of a battery.
Slide 5: image5.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-3.jpg
  Alt: Positive charges move through a section of wire of cross-section A.
Slide 6: image6.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-4.jpg
  Alt: In part (a), positive charges move in the same direction as the current and electric field. In part (b), negative charges move against the direction of the current and electric field.
Slide 7: image7.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-5.jpg
  Alt: The random path and collisions of an electron moving in an electrical conductor opposite the current and electric field.
Slide 8: image8.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-6.jpg
  Alt: A graph showing alternating current in which the current increases and decreases at regular intervals, and the direction of the current changing from one direction to another (arrows pointing left or right)
Slide 9: image9.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-7.jpg
  Alt: The graph shows current in milliamperes on the y-axis and voltage in volts on the x-axis with a straight line such that at 3V, the current is 3 mA.
Slide 10: image10.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-8.jpg
  Alt: Part (a) shows a circuit board with a small “chip.” Part (b) shows a high-power electric power transmission station.
Slide 11: image11.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-9.jpg
  Alt: Part (a) shows a circuit diagram with a zigzag line of a resistor, a battery, and current. Part (b) shows an analogous water circuit with a pump (similar to a battery) and a sand filter (similar to the resistor).
Slide 12: image12.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-10.jpg
  Alt: Typical resistors of various color values are shown.
Slide 13: image13.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-11.jpg
  Alt: A circuit diagram showing a battery and resistor at constant voltage: V=Vbattery and V=Vground=0.
Slide 14: image14.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-12.jpg
  Alt: Part (a) is a circuit diagram with a battery, switch, and capacitor. Part (b) is an analogous water circuit with a pump (like a battery), a valve (like a switch), and a stretchable membrane (like a capacitor).
Slide 15: image15.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-13.jpg
  Alt: The left shows a microprocessor chip; the right shows a missile being launched.
Slide 16: image16.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-14.jpg
  Alt: The left circuit diagram shows three resistors and a battery connected in series. The right circuit diagram shows one resistor that is equivalent to the combination of the three resistors shown on the left.
Slide 17: image17.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-15.jpg
  Alt: An image is shown with a continuous line. The line starts out straight and black, becomes red and up and down pointed, and goes back to straight and black.
Slide 18: image18.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-16.jpg
  Alt: On the left is a circuit diagram with three resistors connected in parallel. On the right is a circuit diagram with only one resistor that has equivalent resistance to the three resistors shown on the left.
Slide 19: image19.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-17.jpg
  Alt: Four steps are shown to simplify a complex circuit diagram of seven resistors to one with only a single equivalent resistor. Initially, two groups of parallel resistors, circled by the blue dashed loop, are combined; then, two resistors in series, circled by the red dashed loop, are combined, which is then combined with a resistor in parallel, circled by the green dashed loop; finally, two resistors in series are combined, circled by the purple dashed loop, yielding the final diagram.
Slide 20: image20.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-18.jpg
  Alt: A “dogbot” in the general shape of a dog is shown
Slide 21: image21.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-19.jpg
  Alt: This shows a vertical parallel circuit. In the middle of either side there are resistors. The left resistor is labeled R1 = 35Ω. The right resistor is labeled R1 = 55Ω
Slide 22: image22.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-20.jpg
  Alt: The left image shows a 25-W light bulb, whereas the right image shows a 60-W light bulb.
Slide 23: image23.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-21.jpg
  Alt: A circuit diagram with one resistor and one battery is shown.
Slide 24: image24.jpg -> phys11-electric-circuits-fig19-22.jpg
