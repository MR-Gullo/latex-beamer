Slide 3: image3.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-1.jpg
  Alt: A fallen tree lies on the ground in a forest.
Slide 4: image4.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-2.jpg
  Alt: A string bulges to the right, creating compression ahead of it and rarefaction behind it.
Slide 5: image5.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-3.jpg
  Alt: A string bulges to the left, creating compression ahead of it and rarefaction behind it.
Slide 6: image6.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-4.jpg
  Alt: A string vibrates back and forth from left to right. The graph of its position is sinusoidal in shape, with amplitude decreasing over time.
Slide 7: image7.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-5.jpg
  Alt: A sound wave with areas of alternating compression and rarefaction enter an ear canal and eardrum.
Slide 8: image8.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-6.jpg
  Alt: The photograph shows fireworks exploding in the night sky.
Slide 9: image9.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-7.jpg
  Alt: A tuning fork vibrates back and forth, creating sound waves.
Slide 10: image10.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-8.jpg
  Alt: A bat produces sound waves that bounce off of a fly and back to the bat.
Slide 11: image11.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-9.jpg
  Alt: Multiple lanes of traffic crowd a busy street.
Slide 12: image12.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-10.jpg
  Alt: This figure has two panels. In the upper panel, a bird chirping at low volume produces sound waves with small amplitudes. In the lower panel, a bird chirping at high volume produces sound waves with large amplitudes.
Slide 13: image13.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-11.jpg
  Alt: The outer ear contains the ear canal, the middle ear contains the eardrum and oval window, and the inner ear contains the cochlea.
Slide 14: image14.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-12.jpg
  Alt: The cochlea is a coiled tube with cilia inside, located in the inner ear.
Slide 15: image15.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-13.jpg
  Alt: A man plays the guitar while his friends sing along around a campfire.
Slide 16: image16.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-14.jpg
  Alt: Sounds emitted by a stationary car spread out in spherical waves as stationary observers listen on both sides.
Slide 17: image17.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-15.jpg
  Alt: Sound waves are compressed ahead of the motion of a car and stretched out in the wake of the motion of the car as stationary observers listen on both sides.
Slide 18: image18.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-16.jpg
  Alt: One observer runs away from the sound source (a car) while another runs toward it.
Slide 19: image19.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-17.jpg
  Alt: The first sonic boom trails behind the nose of the aircraft and the second trails behind the tail.
Slide 20: image20.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-18.jpg
  Alt: A ball bobs up and down with the greatest amplitude when the finger drives its oscillation at the fundamental frequency.
Slide 21: image21.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-19.jpg
  Alt: Shown is a pair of adjustable, black, over-the-ear headphones.
Slide 22: image22.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-20.jpg
  Alt: Wave 1 and wave 2 have different frequencies, and produce a resultant wave with varying amplitude.
Slide 23: image23.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-21.jpg
  Alt: The vibration from a tuning fork sends a wave disturbance through the air down the tube.
Slide 24: image24.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-22.jpg
  Alt: The vibration from a tuning fork reflects back off the closed end of the tube.
Slide 25: image25.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-23.jpg
  Alt: The disturbance is at maximum displacement as it reaches the opening of the tube.
Slide 26: image26.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-24.jpg
  Alt: When there is one node at the closed end, and one antinode at the open end, this forms one quarter of the complete wave cycle (and therefore, one quarter of the wavelength).
Slide 27: image27.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-25.jpg
  Alt: A closed pipe resonator with ¾ wavelength is shown. It has two nodes and two antinodes inside of the tube.
Slide 28: image28.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-26.jpg
  Alt: The fundamental has a wavelength of 4L, and a frequency of v/4L. The first overtone has a wavelength of 4L/3 and a frequency of 3v/4L. The second overtone has a wavelength of 4L/5 and a frequency of 5v/4L. The third overtone has a wavelength of 4L/7 and a frequency of 7v/4L.
Slide 29: image29.jpg -> phys11-sound-fig14-27.jpg
  Alt: The fundamental frequency is v/2L and has a wavelength of 2L. The first overtone has a wavelength of L and a frequency of v/L. The second overtone has a wavelength of 2L/3 and a frequency of 3v/2L. The third overtone has a wavelength of ½L and a frequency of 2v/L.
