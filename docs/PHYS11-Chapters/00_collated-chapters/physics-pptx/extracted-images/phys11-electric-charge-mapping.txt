  Alt: This figure has three parts. Part a: It shows a glass rod suspended from its middle by a string and a nearby silk cloth held from its upper edge by a hand. The glass rod has a series of plus signs, and the silk cloth has many minus signs. There are several faded images of the glass rod and a downward pointing arrow, suggesting the rod's movement toward the cloth. The lower edge of the cloth bends toward the rod. Part b: It shows two glass rods near each other, each with a series of plus signs. One rod is held from one end by a hand, and the other rod is suspended from its middle by a string. There are several faded images of the suspended rod and an upward pointing arrow, suggesting its movement away from the handheld rod. Part c: It shows two silk cloths held by hand near each other, each with a number of minus signs. The lower edges of the cloths curve away from each other.

  Alt: This figure has two drawings, side by side. The drawing on the left shows a large blue sphere, one-eighth of which has been cut out. A number of small red spheres are on the surface of the blue sphere and within the cut-away part of the blue sphere. Also, a number of faded red spheres lie within the blue sphere. The drawing on the right shows four ellipses evenly spaced around a common center, with a small blue sphere in each ellipse. Near the top is the word “Electrons,” with two lines connecting that word to two of the blue spheres. The common center contains a clump of four small red spheres and five small gray spheres. Near the top is another word, “Nucleus,” with a line connecting that word to the clump of spheres at the center.
Slide 6: image6.jpg -> phys11-electric-charge-fig18-4.jpg
  Alt: This figure is a two-part drawing. One part consists of two circular plates held parallel to each other, with a beam of light shining between them. Each plate has a wire attached to it. The upper plate, with a tiny hole at its center, is marked with a plus sign, and the lower plate is marked with a minus sign. A small spray bottle, labeled “Atomizer,” is held by a hand near and just above the upper plate. The hand squeezes a bulb on the Atomizer, and a spray labeled “Oil” emerges just above the upper plate. The beam of light emerges from a source labeled “Bright light.” The drawing includes a telescope-like device aimed for viewing between the circular plates. The second part of the drawing, located slightly below the first part, shows an edge-on view of the two plates. A downward pointing arrow connects the plates in the first part of the drawing to those in the second part. In the latter drawing, four vertical blue arrows point from the upper to the lower plate, and the arrow on the extreme right is labeled as E. A gray sphere between the two plates is labeled “Oil droplet.” A short red arrow, labeled F subscript E, points from the sphere to the upper plate, and another short red arrow, labeled w, points from the sphere to the lower plate.
