# Chapter 4: Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion

## Content Progression

### Review from Physics 11:

- Newton's First Law (Inertia), Second Law (Î£F=ma), and Third Law (Action-Reaction) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 4.2, 4.3, 4.4).
- Concept of net force and the ability to draw free-body diagrams (FBDs) for a single object (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 4.1).
- Identifying common forces: gravity (weight), normal force, and tension (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 4.1, 4.3).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- Defining the "system" of interest as a key problem-solving step (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 4.3).
- Applying Newton's Laws to systems of two or more connected objects (e.g., Atwood machines, trains of blocks) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 4.7).
- Introduction to the four basic forces in nature (gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, strong nuclear) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 4.8).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Analyzing multi-body systems by drawing separate FBDs for each object and recognizing action-reaction pairs between them.
- Setting up and solving a system of simultaneous linear equations derived from applying Newton's Second Law to each object in a system.
