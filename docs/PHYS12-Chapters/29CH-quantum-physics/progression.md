# Chapter 29: Introduction to Quantum Physics

## Content Progression

### Review from Physics 11:

- **Quantization of Energy**: The concept of the photon and Planck's formula (E = hf) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 21.1).
- The **Photoelectric Effect** as evidence for the particle nature of light (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 21.2).
- **Particle-Wave Duality**: The concept that light exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 21.3).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- **Photon Momentum**: The concept that photons, despite being massless, carry momentum (p = h/λ) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 29.4).
- The **Wave Nature of Matter**: De Broglie's hypothesis that all matter has a characteristic wavelength (λ = h/p) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 29.6).
- The **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**, which places fundamental limits on the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties (like position and momentum) can be known (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 29.7).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Applying the photoelectric effect equation (KE_max = hf - W₀) to calculate maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons, work functions, and threshold frequencies.
- Calculating the de Broglie wavelength of matter particles (e.g., electrons) and comparing it to physical dimensions to understand when wave-like properties become significant (e.g., electron diffraction).
