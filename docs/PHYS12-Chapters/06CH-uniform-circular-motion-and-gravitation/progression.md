# Chapter 6: Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation

## Content Progression

This unit synthesizes dynamics, circular motion, and gravitation to describe celestial mechanics.

### Review from Physics 11:

- Description of Uniform Circular Motion (UCM) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 6.2).
- Centripetal acceleration (ac = v²/r) and the concept that it is caused by a net centripetal force (Fc = mac) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 6.2).
- Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation (F_g = Gm₁m₂/r²) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 7.2).
- Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion (qualitative understanding) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 7.1).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- Formal definitions of rotational kinematics variables: **Rotation Angle (θ)** and **Angular Velocity (ω)** (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 6.1).
- Understanding fictitious forces (like the centrifugal force) as phenomena experienced in non-inertial (accelerating) frames of reference (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 6.4).

### Synthesis & Application:

- The core synthesis is analyzing **satellite and planetary orbits** (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 6.6). Students must equate the gravitational force to the required centripetal force (Gm_planet*m_sat / r² = m_sat*v² / r) to derive equations for orbital speed and period. This is the crucial link between gravitation and circular motion.
