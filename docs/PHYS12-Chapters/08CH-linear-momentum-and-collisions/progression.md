# Chapter 8: Linear Momentum and Collisions

## Content Progression

This unit extends the powerful conservation of momentum principle to two dimensions.

### Review from Physics 11:

- Definition of linear momentum (p = mv) and impulse (J = FΔt) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 8.1).
- The Impulse-Momentum Theorem (J = Δp) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 8.1).
- The Law of Conservation of Momentum in a closed system (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 8.2).
- Classifying collisions as elastic (KE is conserved) and inelastic (KE is not conserved) in one dimension (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 8.3).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- Analysis of **collisions in two dimensions** (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 8.6).
- Introduction to the principles of rocket propulsion as an application of momentum conservation (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 8.7).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Applying the Law of Conservation of Momentum in two dimensions. This requires students to resolve initial momentum vectors into x and y components and apply conservation separately for each axis (Σpx_initial = Σpx_final and Σpy_initial = Σpy_final) to find the final velocity vectors of the colliding objects.
