# Chapter 23: Electromagnetic Induction, AC Circuits, and Electrical Technologies

## Content Progression

### Review from Physics 11:

- Qualitative understanding of **Electromagnetic Induction**: a changing magnetic field can induce a current (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 20.3).
- Basic operational principles of electric generators and transformers (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 20.2).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- **Magnetic Flux (ΦB)**: A quantitative measure of the magnetic field passing through an area (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 23.1).
- **Faraday's Law of Induction**: The induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux (ε = -N ΔΦB/Δt) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 23.2).
- **Lenz's Law**: The direction of the induced current opposes the change in flux that created it (the minus sign in Faraday's Law) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 23.2).
- **Motional EMF** (ε = BLv) induced in a conductor moving through a magnetic field (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 23.3).
- Inductance (L) and the analysis of RL and RLC circuits (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 23.9 - 23.12).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Using Faraday's Law and Lenz's Law together to solve problems. Students must first calculate the change in magnetic flux and then use Lenz's Law (via a second Right-Hand Rule) to determine the direction of the resulting induced current.
