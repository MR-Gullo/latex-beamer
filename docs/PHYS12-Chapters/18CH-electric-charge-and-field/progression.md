# Chapter 18: Electric Charge and Electric Field

## Content Progression

This unit deepens the understanding of electric fields and introduces the critical concept of electric potential.

### Review from Physics 11:

- Properties of electric charge (positive/negative, quantized, conserved) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 18.1).
- Distinction between conductors and insulators (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 18.1).
- Charging by conduction and induction (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 18.1).
- **Coulomb's Law** (F_e = kq₁q₂/r²) for the force between two point charges (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 18.2).
- Definition of the Electric Field (E = F/q) as a force per unit charge (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 18.3).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- Visualizing **Electric Field Lines** for multiple and complex charge configurations (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 18.5).
- The behavior of **Conductors in Electrostatic Equilibrium**: the electric field inside is zero, and excess charge resides on the surface (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 18.7).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Applying the **principle of superposition** to calculate the net electric force and net electric field at a point in space due to multiple source charges. This requires performing vector addition of the forces or fields from each source.
