# Chapter 19: Electric Potential and Electric Field

## Content Progression

### Review from Physics 11:

- The concept of Electric Potential (Voltage) as electric potential energy per unit charge (V = PE/q) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 18.4).
- Introduction to capacitors as devices that store charge (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 18.5).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- Rigorous relationship between a uniform electric field and potential difference (ΔV = -Ed) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 19.2).
- **Equipotential Lines/Surfaces**: Lines or surfaces where the electric potential is constant (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 19.4).
- Analysis of **Capacitors in Series and Parallel** and the calculation of equivalent capacitance (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 19.6).
- Calculating the **Energy Stored in a Capacitor** (U = ½CV²) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 19.7).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Relating the work done on a charge to its change in kinetic energy as it moves through a potential difference (Work-Energy Theorem for electrostatics: W = qΔV = ΔKE).
- Analyzing circuits containing combinations of series and parallel capacitors to find charge, voltage, and stored energy for each component.
