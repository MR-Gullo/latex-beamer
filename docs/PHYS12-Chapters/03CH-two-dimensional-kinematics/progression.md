# Chapter 3: Two-Dimensional Kinematics

## Content Progression

### Review from Physics 11:

- Adding and subtracting vectors using the head-to-tail graphical method (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 5.1).
- Resolving vectors into perpendicular (x and y) components (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 5.2).
- Adding vectors analytically using their components (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 5.2).
- The foundational concept of projectile motion as independent horizontal (constant velocity) and vertical (constant acceleration) motion (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 5.3).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- Formal study of **Relative Velocity**, referred to as "Addition of Velocities" (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 3.5). This involves a more rigorous vector treatment for objects moving in a medium that is also moving (e.g., a boat in a river, a plane in the wind).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Solving complex projectile motion problems launched at an angle from a non-zero height.
- Applying analytical vector addition to solve quantitative relative velocity problems, determining the resultant velocity and direction of an object relative to a stationary observer.
