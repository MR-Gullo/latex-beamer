# Chapter 21: Circuits and DC Instruments

## Content Progression

Students move from simple circuits to complex, multi-loop circuits requiring new analytical tools.

### Review from Physics 11:

- Rules for calculating equivalent resistance for resistors in series (Req = R₁ + R₂ + ...) and parallel (1/Req = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + ...) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 19.2, 19.3).
- Solving for current and voltage in simple combination circuits (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 19.3).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- **Electromotive Force (EMF, ε)**: The work done per unit charge by a source, and its distinction from the terminal voltage due to internal resistance (V_T = ε - Ir) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 21.2).
- **Kirchhoff's Rules**: The Junction Rule (conservation of charge) and the Loop Rule (conservation of energy) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 21.3).
- Introduction to **RC Circuits**: circuits containing both resistors and capacitors (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 21.6).

### Synthesis & Application:

- The primary application is using **Kirchhoff's Rules to analyze complex multi-loop circuits** that cannot be simplified by series/parallel rules alone. This requires students to set up a system of linear equations based on the rules and solve them for the unknown currents in each branch.
