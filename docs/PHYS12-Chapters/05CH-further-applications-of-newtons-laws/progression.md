# Chapter 5: Further Applications of Newton's Laws: Friction, Drag, and Elasticity

## Content Progression

### Review from Physics 11:

- The model for static friction (fs ≤ μsN) and kinetic friction (fk = μkN) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 5.4).
- Applying friction forces to problems, particularly on inclined planes (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 5.4).
- Hooke's Law (F = -kx) as it relates to Simple Harmonic Motion (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 5.5).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- **Drag Forces**: Introducing the concept of forces that depend on velocity, such as air resistance (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 5.2).
- **Elasticity**: A more formal treatment of material properties, including the concepts of stress and strain (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 5.3).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Applying Newton's Second Law to situations where drag is significant, leading to the concept of terminal velocity (where net force becomes zero).
- Solving dynamics problems that involve the interplay between gravitational forces, friction, tension, and elastic (spring) forces simultaneously.
