# Chapter 20: Electric Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law

## Content Progression

### Review from Physics 11:

- Definition of electric current (I = Δq/Δt) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 19.1).
- **Ohm's Law** (V = IR) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 19.1).
- Calculating electric power (P = IV = I²R = V²/R) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 19.4).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- **Resistivity (ρ)**: Understanding how a material's intrinsic properties, length, and cross-sectional area determine its resistance (R = ρL/A) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 20.3).
- Deeper comparison of **Alternating Current (AC)** and **Direct Current (DC)** (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 20.5).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Designing and analyzing the properties of a resistor based on its physical characteristics.
- Solving more complex power problems, such as analyzing the power dissipated in different parts of a combination circuit.
