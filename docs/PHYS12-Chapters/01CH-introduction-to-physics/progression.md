# Chapter 1: Introduction: The Nature of Science and Physics

## Content Progression

This introductory unit serves to solidify foundational skills with greater mathematical rigor before applying them to more advanced topics.

### Review from Physics 11:

- The scientific method, models, and theories (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 1.2).
- Physical quantities, SI base units (meter, kilogram, second), and derived units (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 1.3).
- Metric prefixes and scientific notation (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 1.3).
- Concepts of accuracy, precision, uncertainty, and the rules for significant figures in calculations (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 1.3).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- Formalizing the concept of _approximation_ and order-of-magnitude estimates as a problem-solving tool (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 1.4).
- Reinforcing the distinction between a scientific law and a theory with more nuanced examples.

### Synthesis & Application:

- Applying principles of significant figures and uncertainty propagation to the more complex, multi-step calculations that will be required throughout the Physics 12 course.
