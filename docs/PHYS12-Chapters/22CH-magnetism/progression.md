# Chapter 22: Magnetism

## Content Progression

This unit quantifies the relationship between electricity and magnetism.

### Review from Physics 11:

- Basic properties of magnets (poles, magnetic field lines) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 20.1).
- Concept that moving charges (currents) create magnetic fields (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 20.1).
- The existence of a force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field (qualitative) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 20.1).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- The magnetic force on a single moving point charge: **F = qvBsinθ** and the associated Right-Hand Rule (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 22.4).
- The magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor: **F = ILBsinθ** (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 22.7).
- **Torque on a Current Loop**, which is the principle behind electric motors (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 22.8).
- **Ampere's Law** for calculating the magnetic field produced by a current (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 22.9).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Analyzing the motion of charged particles in a uniform magnetic field. By equating the magnetic force to the centripetal force (qvB = mv²/r), students can solve for the radius and period of the circular path, the principle behind mass spectrometers.
