# Chapter 2: Kinematics (One-Dimensional)

## Content Progression

### Review from Physics 11:

- Distinction between scalars (distance, speed) and vectors (displacement, velocity) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 2.1).
- Definitions of average velocity and average speed (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 2.2).
- Definition of average acceleration (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 3.1).
- Interpretation of position-time and velocity-time graphs, including the significance of slope and area under the curve (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 2.3, 2.4).
- Basic kinematic equations for constant acceleration (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 3.2).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- Derivation and application of the full set of one-dimensional kinematic equations, including `v² = v₀² + 2aΔd` (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 2.5).
- A more structured and formal problem-solving methodology for kinematic problems (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 2.6).
- Detailed graphical analysis, including the relationship between the concavity of a position-time graph and the sign of acceleration (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 2.8).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Solving multi-stage 1D motion problems where acceleration changes between stages (e.g., a rocket launch profile).
- Using graphical analysis to derive quantitative information for objects undergoing non-uniform acceleration.
