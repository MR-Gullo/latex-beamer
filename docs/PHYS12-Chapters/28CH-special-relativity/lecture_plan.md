# Special Relativity Unit Plan (Grade 12 Physics)

The content in this directory is **highly suitable** for a complete Grade 12 Physics unit. It builds upon Physics 11 concepts (postulates, basic dilation/contraction) and extends them into relativistic mechanics (momentum/energy).

## Lecture Structure

### Lecture 1: The Geometry of Spacetime (Kinematics)
**Slides:** `src/phys12/slides/ch28_slides_relativity_Part1.tex`
**Focus:** Conceptual shifts and how measurement changes between reference frames.

*   **28-1 Einstein’s Postulates:** The laws of physics are invariant; speed of light ($c$) is constant.
*   **28-2 Simultaneity & Time Dilation:** The loss of absolute simultaneity and the "moving clocks run slow" phenomenon ($\Delta t = \gamma \Delta t_0$).
*   **28-3 Length Contraction:** How space shortens in the direction of motion ($L = L_0 / \gamma$).

### Lecture 2: Relativistic Mechanics (Dynamics)
**Slides:** `src/phys12/slides/ch28_slides_relativity_Part2.tex`
**Focus:** Mass, energy, and how objects behave as they approach light speed.

*   **28-4 Relativistic Addition of Velocities:** The failure of Galilean addition at high speeds ($u = (v+u') / (1+vu'/c^2)$).
*   **28-5 Relativistic Momentum:** Why massive objects cannot reach $c$ ($p = \gamma mv$).
*   **28-6 Relativistic Energy:** Mass-energy equivalence ($E=mc^2$), Rest Energy, and Total Energy ($E = \gamma mc^2$).
