# Chapter 28: Special Relativity

## Content Progression

This unit explores the paradigm shifts of the early 20th century, from relativity to quantum mechanics.

### Review from Physics 11:

- The two postulates of Special Relativity (laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames; the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial observers) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 10.1).
- Consequences of the postulates: **time dilation** and **length contraction** (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 10.2).
- Mass-energy equivalence (E = mc²) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 10.2).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- **Relativistic Addition of Velocities** (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 28.4).
- **Relativistic Momentum** (p = γmu) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 28.5).
- **Relativistic Energy**: Distinguishing between rest energy (E₀ = mc²) and total energy (E = γmc²) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 28.6).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Solving quantitative problems using the Lorentz factor (γ) to find time dilation, length contraction, relativistic momentum, and energy for objects traveling at speeds close to the speed of light.
