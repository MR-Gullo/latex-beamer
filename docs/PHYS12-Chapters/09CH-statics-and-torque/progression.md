# Chapter 9: Statics and Torque

## Content Progression

### Review from Physics 11:

- Definition of torque (τ = rFsinθ) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 6.3).
- The concept that a net torque causes angular acceleration (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 6.3).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- **The First Condition for Equilibrium**: The net force on the object must be zero (ΣF = 0) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 9.1).
- **The Second Condition for Equilibrium**: The net torque about any pivot point must be zero (Στ = 0) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 9.2).
- Concepts of stable, unstable, and neutral equilibrium (Stability) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 9.3).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Solving complex static equilibrium problems for extended bodies (e.g., ladders against walls, beams supported by cables). This requires applying _both_ conditions for equilibrium: resolving all forces into x and y components and summing them to zero, and summing all torques about a strategically chosen pivot point to zero.
