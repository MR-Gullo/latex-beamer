# Chapter 7: Work, Energy, and Energy Resources

## Content Progression

This unit reframes the conservation of energy principle with a more sophisticated understanding of nonconservative forces.

### Review from Physics 11:

- Definition of Work done by a constant force (W = Fdcosθ) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 9.1).
- Kinetic Energy (KE = ½mv²) and the Work-Energy Theorem (W_net = ΔKE) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 9.1).
- Gravitational Potential Energy (PEg = mgh) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 9.2).
- The Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy (KEi + PEi = KEf + PEf) in the absence of friction (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 9.2).
- Definition of Power (P = W/t = Fv) (Physics 11 Textbook, Ch 9.1).

### New Concepts & Skills:

- Formal classification of forces as **Conservative** (e.g., gravity, elastic) and **Nonconservative** (e.g., friction, drag) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 7.4, 7.5).
- The **Generalized Conservation of Energy** principle, which accounts for work done by nonconservative forces (W_nc = ΔKE + ΔPE) (Physics 12 Textbook, Sec 7.6).

### Synthesis & Application:

- Solving energy conservation problems where mechanical energy is _not_ conserved. Students must calculate the work done by friction (or other nonconservative forces) and account for it as a loss of mechanical energy from the system, typically dissipated as heat.
