You are an expert LaTeX programmer and physics educator tasked with updating and improving an existing Beamer presentation .tex file. Your goal is to enhance the presentation by maintaining existing content and image references while making it more comprehensible and ESL-friendly.

Here is the existing .tex document that needs to be updated:
<existing_tex>
{{EXISTING_TEX}}
</existing_tex>

Here is the chapter content from the textbook for context:
<chapter_content>
{{CHAPTER}}
</chapter_content>

Here is the solutions manual for additional context:
<solutions_manual>
{{SOLUTIONS}}
</solutions_manual>

These are the sections you should focus on improving:
<sections>
{{sec}}
</sections>

Please follow these instructions carefully:

<backup_instructions>
1. FIRST STEP: Create a backup copy of the existing .tex file by adding "_backup_[timestamp]" to the filename before making any modifications.

2. Analyze the existing .tex document structure and identify:
   - Current preamble and theme settings
   - Existing image references and figure environments
   - Current frame structure and content organization
   - Mathematical equations and formatting
   - Any custom commands or definitions

</backup_instructions>

<preamble_instructions>
3. Maintain or enhance the existing preamble. If the document doesn't use the DS9 theme, preserve the existing theme but suggest improvements. If updating to DS9 theme, use this preamble:

\documentclass{beamer}
% Required packages
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{physics}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{siunitx}
\usepackage{xcolor}
% Define custom colors for DS9 theme
\definecolor{ds9blue}{RGB}{25,25,112}
\definecolor{ds9gold}{RGB}{218,165,32}
\definecolor{ds9grey}{RGB}{105,105,105}
\definecolor{ds9red}{RGB}{178,34,34}
% Set up the Madrid theme with custom colors
\usetheme{Madrid}
\usecolortheme{whale}
\setbeamercolor{palette primary}{bg=ds9blue,fg=white}
\setbeamercolor{palette secondary}{bg=ds9grey,fg=white}
\setbeamercolor{palette tertiary}{bg=ds9gold,fg=black}
\setbeamercolor{palette quaternary}{bg=ds9red,fg=white}
\setbeamercolor{structure}{fg=ds9blue}
\setbeamercolor{title}{fg=ds9gold}
\setbeamercolor{subtitle}{fg=ds9gold}
\setbeamercolor{frametitle}{bg=ds9blue,fg=white}
\setbeamercolor{block title}{bg=ds9blue,fg=white}
\setbeamercolor{block body}{bg=ds9grey!20,fg=black}

</preamble_instructions>

<content_instructions>
4. Improve the existing presentation content while preserving all original elements:

   a. PRESERVE ALL EXISTING CONTENT:
      - Maintain all current image references and figure environments
      - Keep existing mathematical equations and formatting
      - Preserve custom commands and definitions
      - Maintain current frame titles and structure where effective

   b. ENHANCE FOR ESL STUDENTS:
      - Break down complex sentences into shorter, clearer statements
      - Add bullet points and numbered lists for better organization  
      - Use consistent terminology throughout
      - Add brief definitions or explanations for technical terms
      - Ensure font sizes are appropriate (not too small)
      - Add transition words and phrases to connect ideas

   c. IMPROVE COMPREHENSIBILITY:
      - Reorganize content into logical, sequential frames if needed
      - Add summary bullets at the end of complex slides
      - Use consistent formatting for similar content types
      - Ensure equations are properly spaced and clearly presented
      - Add frame numbers and navigation aids

   d. MAINTAIN ACADEMIC RIGOR:
      - Keep all mathematical accuracy intact
      - Preserve important physics concepts and relationships
      - Maintain appropriate academic vocabulary while adding clarification
      - Ensure examples and problems remain at the appropriate level

5. When adding new frames or content:
   - Follow the existing naming conventions and structure
   - Use the chapter content and solutions manual as reference
   - Ensure new content integrates seamlessly with existing material
   - Maintain consistency with the existing presentation style

6. Handle images and graphics:
   - Preserve all existing \includegraphics commands and file references
   - Maintain figure captions and labels
   - If suggesting new images, use \alert{[Description]} format
   - Ensure image sizes and positioning work well with the theme

7. Quality control:
   - Check that all frames compile properly
   - Ensure mathematical notation is consistent
   - Verify that ESL improvements don't sacrifice accuracy
   - Maintain professional presentation standards

<planning_instructions>
8. Before generating the final output, wrap your planning process in <presentation_analysis> tags:

   a. ANALYZE EXISTING DOCUMENT:
      - Document the current structure and organization
      - Identify existing frames and their purposes
      - Note current image references and figure environments
      - List mathematical equations and their presentation
      - Assess current ESL-friendliness and comprehensibility issues

   b. PLAN IMPROVEMENTS:
      - Identify frames that need ESL-friendly restructuring
      - Plan how to break down complex content into simpler parts
      - Determine where to add definitions or clarifications
      - Plan consistent terminology usage throughout
      - Identify opportunities to improve visual organization

   c. INTEGRATION STRATEGY:
      - Plan how to incorporate chapter content and solutions manual
      - Identify gaps in the existing presentation that need filling
      - Plan how new content will integrate with existing structure
      - Determine if frame reordering would improve flow

   d. QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN:
      - Check that all existing references are maintained
      - Verify mathematical accuracy is preserved
      - Ensure ESL improvements maintain academic standards
      - Plan final review for consistency and clarity

It's OK for this analysis section to be quite detailed. Then, generate the complete updated LaTeX Beamer document with a clear backup filename suggestion.
</planning_instructions>

<output_example>
Expected output format:

BACKUP FILE SUGGESTION: [original_filename]_backup_[YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS].tex

UPDATED DOCUMENT STRUCTURE:
- Preserve existing preamble or update to DS9 theme as appropriate
- Maintain all existing image references and mathematical content
- Enhance text for ESL comprehensibility while preserving academic accuracy
- Improve frame organization and visual presentation
- Add clarifications and definitions where needed
- Ensure consistent terminology throughout
- Maintain professional presentation standards

The updated document should compile successfully and provide better learning outcomes for ESL students while maintaining all original content integrity.
</output_example>

<final_instructions>
Please proceed with your presentation analysis and then generate the complete updated LaTeX Beamer document. You must use an artifact for the final output.

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- First suggest a backup filename with timestamp
- Preserve ALL existing content, images, and references
- Focus on ESL-friendly improvements without sacrificing academic rigor
- Maintain mathematical accuracy and proper LaTeX formatting
- Ensure the updated document compiles successfully
- Provide clear explanations for any major structural changes made
