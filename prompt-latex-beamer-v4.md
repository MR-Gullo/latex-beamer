## Required LaTeX Structure

**Preamble (use exactly):**
```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
% Use DS9 global theme (includes pgfplots for visualization)
\usepackage{../../../shared/templates/ds9_theme}

% Title page configuration
\title[Short Title]{PHYS11 CH:<specified sections>}
\subtitle{<appropriate subtitle>}
\author[Mr. Gullo]{Mr. Gullo}
\date[<short date>]{<full date>}
```

## Presentation Content Structure

Create a comprehensive slideshow containing:

### Core Content Slides
1. **Learning objectives slide** - Clear bullet points outlining what students will understand after the lesson, extracted directly from the specified textbook sections

2. **Key concepts and definitions slides** - Important physics terms, principles, and conceptual explanations presented in digestible chunks with clear explanations

3. **Essential equations slide** - Critical formulas from the sections with brief explanations of when and how to use them, including variable definitions

4. **Concept visualization slides** - Custom-created plots and diagrams using tikz/pgfplots to illustrate abstract physics concepts visually. Examples include:
   - Position, velocity, acceleration vs time graphs
   - Force vector diagrams and free body diagrams
   - Wave functions and periodic phenomena
   - Energy vs position plots
   - Other relevant physics visualizations specific to your sections

### Interactive Learning Sequence
5. **"I do, We do, You do" example series** - Three related problems of increasing independence (use only problems from the provided PDF):
   - **"I do"**: Complete worked example with detailed step-by-step solution using the GUESS method
   - **"We do"**: Partially solved problem designed for classroom participation and discussion
   - **"You do"**: Unsolved practice problem for independent student work

### GUESS Method for Problem Solving
For all example problems, use the GUESS method structure:
- **G - Givens**: List all known quantities with correct variable symbols (e.g., vâ‚€ = 5 m/s)
- **U - Unknown**: Identify the quantity being asked for
- **E - Equation**: Select the physics equation relating givens and unknown
- **S - Substitute**: Plug known values with units into the equation
- **S - Solve**: Perform calculation with correct units in the final answer

6. **Summary slide** - Key takeaways, main concepts review, and connections between ideas

## Formatting and Technical Guidelines

### LaTeX Formatting Requirements
- Use clear, descriptive frame titles for organization and navigation
- Include `\section{Topic Name}` commands to populate the table of contents structure
- Employ proper LaTeX formatting: mathematical equations, itemized lists, appropriate spacing
- Use `\alert{[description of external image]}` only for placeholders referencing external image files

### Visualization Standards
- Create simple, easily readable plots using tikz/pgfplots with:
  - Large, clear axis labels and units
  - Appropriate scales and tick marks
  - Thick lines for visibility during projection
  - Minimal complexity focusing on key conceptual understanding
  - Consistent styling with the DS9 theme colors

## Planning and Development Process

Before generating the final LaTeX document, create a detailed outline in `<presentation_outline>` tags that includes:

- **Section-by-section concept extraction**: List the key physics concepts, definitions, and principles from each specified textbook section
- **Visualization planning**: Identify specific plots, graphs, or diagrams needed to illustrate abstract concepts, including axis labels, data ranges, and visual elements
- **Example problem selection**: Choose three problems from the PDF that represent different difficulty levels and cover various aspects of the content
- **Slide sequence organization**: Plan the logical flow and structure of your presentation frames

Generate the complete LaTeX Beamer document in an artifact, ensuring all requirements are met and the presentation flows logically from introduction through practice exercises.
