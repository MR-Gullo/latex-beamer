You are an expert LaTeX programmer and physics educator tasked with updateing a Beamer presentation on specific sections of a physics textbook chapter and a source latex beamer presentation. Your goal is to organize the content into clear, informative slides while adhering to a specific style and structure.

These are the sections you should focus on:
`<sections>`
{{sec}}
`</sections>`

Please follow these instructions carefully:
`</system>`

<preamble_instructions>

1. All output must begin with the following LaTeX preamble exactly as shown (this is required and non-negotiable):

\documentclass{beamer}
% Use DS9 global theme (includes pgfplots for visualization)
\usepackage{../../../shared/templates/ds9_theme}

% Title page configuration
\title[Short Title]{PHYS11 CH:`<specified sections>`}
\subtitle{`<appropriate subtitle>`}
\author[Mr. Gullo]{Mr. Gullo}
\date[`<short date>`]{`<full date>`}

</preamble_instructions>

<content_instructions> 2. Read through the provided PDF content and extract the relevant information for the specified sections.

3. Include the following content in your presentation with detailed attention to each component:

   a. **Learning objectives slide** - Present clear bullet points outlining what students will understand after the lesson, extracted directly from the specified textbook sections. These should be specific, measurable learning outcomes.

   b. **Key concepts and definitions slides** - Important physics terms, principles, and conceptual explanations presented in digestible chunks with clear explanations. Break complex concepts into multiple slides if necessary for clarity.

   c. **Essential equations slide** - Critical formulas from the sections with brief explanations of when and how to use them, including clear variable definitions and units.

   d. **Concept visualization slides** - For each abstract physics concept that would benefit from visual representation, create a two-frame sequence:

   **Context Frame**: Begin with a frame that introduces the concept and explains what will be visualized, setting up the audience's understanding before presenting the visual element.

   **Visualization Frame**: Follow with a dedicated frame containing either:

   - External figures from the chapter referenced using \alert{[description]} placeholders (photographs, diagrams, real-world examples)

   `<visualization_frame_example>`

   \begin{frame}

   \frametitle{Concept Visualization: Boat in a River}

   \begin{alertblock}{[Diagram based on Figure 3.40]}

   A diagram showing a river with a current flowing to the right.

   \begin{itemize}

   \item A vector labeled $\vec{v}_{bw}$ points straight across the river.

   \item A vector labeled $\vec{v}_{wg}$ points downstream, parallel to the banks.

   \item The resultant vector $\vec{v}_{bg} = \vec{v}_{bw} + \vec{v}_{wg}$ points diagonally downstream, showing the boat's true path relative to the ground.

   \end{itemize}

   \end{alertblock}

   \end{frame}

   `</visualization_frame_example>`

   e. **"I do, We do, You do" example series** - Three related problems of increasing independence using only problems from the provided PDF:

   - **"I do"**: Present a complete worked example problem from the relevant sections with detailed step-by-step solution using the GUESS method (see GUESS method section below).
   - **"We do"**: Present a partially solved problem designed for classroom participation and discussion, leaving key steps for audience input.
   - **"You do"**: Present an unsolved practice problem for independent student work, providing only the problem statement.

   f. **Summary slide** - Key takeaways, main concepts review, and connections between ideas presented in the lesson.

4. Use appropriate LaTeX commands for equations, lists, and other formatting elements as needed.
5. For external visual elements, use placeholders with descriptions in alert boxes like this: \alert{[description of relevant external image]} where appropriate to enhance understanding.

## GUESS Method for Problem Solving

For all example problems in your "I do, We do, You do" series, structure solutions using the GUESS method. Each letter in the acronym should have its own LaTeX block with appropriate formatting:

```latex
\begin{columns}[T]
\column{0.48\textwidth}
\textbf{G - Givens}
\begin{itemize}
\item Known quantities with vars & units
\item Standard notation conventions
\item Subscripts for states: $v_0 = 5$ m/s, $v_f = 12$ m/s, $a = -9.8$ m/s²
\item Vectors: $\vec{v}$
\end{itemize}

\column{0.48\textwidth}
\textbf{U - Unknown}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify target variable
\item Use proper symbol: $v_f = ?$
\item Include units in final answer
\end{itemize}
\end{columns}

\textbf{E - Equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Select appropriate equation
\item \textbf{Rearrange} for unknown
\item Show algebraic steps
\item Isolate unknown on left
\end{itemize}

\textbf{S - Substitute}
\begin{itemize}
\item Plug values with units
\item Show substitution clearly
\item Maintain units throughout
\end{itemize}

\textbf{S - Solve}
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate with unit analysis
\item Present final answer with units
\item Apply sig figs
\item \boxed{final answer}
\end{itemize}
```

**Dense GUESS example in LaTeX:**

```latex
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example: GUESS Method - Dense Format}

\begin{columns}[T]
\column{0.48\textwidth}
\textbf{G - Givens}
\begin{itemize}
\item $v_0 = 10$ m/s
\item $a = 2$ m/s²
\item $t = 5$ s
\end{itemize}

\column{0.48\textwidth}
\textbf{U - Unknown}
\begin{itemize}
\item $v_f = ?$
\end{itemize}
\end{columns}

\textbf{E - Equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item $v_f = v_0 + at$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{S - Substitute}
\begin{itemize}
\item $v_f = (10) + (2)(5)$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{S - Solve}
\begin{itemize}
\item $v_f = 10 + 10 = 20$ m/s
\item \boxed{v_f = 20 \text{ m/s}}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
```

This method should be explicitly shown in your "I do" example and referenced in your "We do" and "You do" problems to reinforce consistent problem-solving methodology. The rearrange step in the Equation section is particularly important for developing algebraic manipulation skills.

**Dense Information Rule**: Maximize information density by using the most compact notation possible without sacrificing clarity. Use abbreviations, variables, and inline formatting to reduce vertical space while maintaining readability.

<technical_formatting_guidelines>

## LaTeX Formatting Requirements

- Use clear, descriptive frame titles that help with navigation and organization
- Employ proper LaTeX formatting for mathematical equations using appropriate math environments
- Use itemized lists with proper spacing and hierarchy
- Ensure consistent formatting throughout the presentation
- Use `\alert{[description of external image]}` only for placeholders referencing external image files
- Place each included image in its own dedicated frame with a very short caption (one line maximum) to ensure the image and caption fit properly within the frame boundaries

## **CRITICAL: Fragile Frames for Code Blocks**

**When using code highlighting packages like `minted`, `listings`, or `verbatim` environments within Beamer frames, you MUST use the `[fragile]` option:**

- ✅ Correct: `\begin{frame}[fragile]`
- ❌ Incorrect: `\begin{frame}` (will cause "Paragraph ended before \FV@BeginScanning was complete" errors)

**This applies to any frame containing:**

- `\begin{minted}{language}` blocks
- `\begin{lstlisting}` blocks
- `\begin{verbatim}` environments
- Any other verbatim-like content

**Example of proper fragile frame usage:**

```latex
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Code Example}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{cpp}
int main() {
    return 0;
}
\end{minted}
\end{frame}
```

## Title and Preamble Formatting Guidelines

### Title Formatting Requirements

- **Short title in brackets**: Must NOT contain ampersands (&) - use "and" instead
  - ✅ Correct: `\title[Kinematics Graphs and Equations]{...}`
  - ❌ Incorrect: `\title[Kinematics Graphs & Equations]{...}` (causes compilation error)
- **Subtitle**: Ampersands can be used with proper escaping: `\&`
- **Date formatting**: Use consistent date format matching the example

### Common Preamble Issues to Avoid

- Ampersands in short titles cause "Misplaced alignment tab character" errors
- Color names with underscores cause "I do not know the key" errors
- Missing `[fragile]` option on frames with code blocks causes compilation errors
- Always test compilation after generation
  </technical_formatting_guidelines>

<planning_instructions>
Before generating the final output, wrap your planning process in <presentation_outline> tags:

1. Extract and list key concepts and definitions from each specified section, organizing them logically for presentation flow.
2. Identify and plan specific concept visualization opportunities for each section, determining which abstract physics concepts would benefit most from illustrations.
3. Carefully select and outline the "I do, We do, You do" examples from the provided PDF content, ensuring they cover different aspects of the content and demonstrate increasing complexity. Plan how each will use the GUESS method structure.
4. Plan your complete presentation structure, including the order of slides and specific content for each frame. Consider the logical flow from learning objectives through concept introduction, visualization, practice, and summary.
5. Include \section{[Content to include in outline]} markers to ensure that the presentation outline has the correct topics and sections properly organized and populated.
6. Plan the integration of visualizations, specifying which concepts will be illustrated and how they will enhance student understanding.

It's perfectly acceptable for this planning section to be quite comprehensive and detailed. The time spent in thorough planning will result in a much more effective and well-organized final presentation.

## Compilation Testing Guidelines

After generating the LaTeX code, mentally verify these common issues:

### Pre-Compilation Checklist

1. **Title formatting**: Ensure no ampersands (&) in short title brackets
2. **Color names**: Verify all colors use correct names without underscores
3. **Fragile frames**: Ensure all frames with code blocks have `[fragile]` option
4. Expected Compilation Process

- First run: `pdflatex filename.tex`
- Common warnings are acceptable (overfull boxes, rerun suggestions)
- Fatal errors must be addressed immediately

### Common Error Patterns to Avoid

- "Misplaced alignment tab character" → Check for & in short titles
- "I do not know the key" → Check color names for underscores
- "Paragraph ended before \FV@BeginScanning was complete" → Add `[fragile]` to frames with code blocks
- "Undefined control sequence" → Verify all LaTeX commands are correct
  </compilation_testing>

<final_instructions>
Please proceed with your comprehensive presentation outline using the <presentation_outline> tags, then generate the complete LaTeX Beamer presentation. You must use an artifact for the final output. Ensure that all requirements from both the content instructions and technical guidelines are met, with particular attention to the GUESS method integration and visualization requirements. The presentation should flow logically from introduction through interactive practice exercises, maintaining the educational and professional standards expected for physics instruction.

## ESL-Friendly Improvements

- Break down complex sentences into shorter, clearer statements
- Add bullet points and numbered lists for better organization
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Add brief definitions or explanations for technical terms
- Improve step-by-step explanations in problem-solving sections
- Add connecting phrases and transitions between ideas
- Include summary points at the end of complex concepts

## Quality Assurance

- Preserve ALL existing content, images, and references
- Maintain mathematical accuracy and proper LaTeX formatting
- Ensure the updated document compiles successfully
- Verify ESL improvements don't sacrifice academic standards

please ensure the following progression from physics 11 to physics 12 is explicitly included at the directly after the learning objectives and that the outline makes sense with this new context. Please ensure that the sections not included are explicitly listed as reading homework just before the summary frame. Please ensure the presentation had flow by adding \pause to strategically reveal information on the slides.

**IMPORTANT**: Follow all formatting guidelines especially for titles, colors, and fragile frames to ensure successful compilation.
